  abstract = {Cloud Doppler radars are increasingly used to study cloud and precipitation microphysical processes. Typical bulk cloud properties such as liquid or ice content are usually derived using the first three standard moments of the radar Doppler spectrum. Recent studies demonstrated the value of higher moments for the reduction of retrieval uncertainties and for providing additional insights into microphysical processes. Large effort has been undertaken, e.g., within the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program to ensure high quality of radar Doppler spectra. However, a systematic approach concerning the accuracy of higher moment estimates and sensitivity to basic radar system settings, such as spectral resolution, integration time and beam width, are still missing. In this study, we present an approach on how to optimize radar settings for radar Doppler spectra moments in the specific context of drizzle detection. The process of drizzle development has shown to be particularly sensitive to higher radar moments such as skewness. We collected radar raw data (I/Q time series) from consecutive zenith-pointing observations for two liquid cloud cases observed at the cloud observatory JOYCE in Germany. The I/Q data allowed us to process Doppler spectra and derive their moments using different spectral resolutions and integration times during identical time intervals. This enabled us to study the sensitivity of the spatiotemporal structure of the derived moments to the different radar settings. The observed signatures were further investigated using a radar Doppler forward model which allowed us to compare observed and simulated sensitivities and also to study the impact of additional hardware-dependent parameters such as antenna beam width. For the observed cloud with drizzle onset we found that longer integration times mainly modify spectral width (S\_w) and skewness (S\_k), leaving other moments mostly unaffected. An integration time of 2s seems to be an optimal compromise: both observations and simulations revealed that a 10s integration time \textendash{} as it is widely used for European cloud radars \textendash{} leads to a significant turbulence-induced increase of S\_w and reduction of S\_k compared to 2 s integration time. This can lead to significantly different microphysical interpretations with respect to drizzle water content and effective radius. A change from 2s to even shorter integration times (0. 4s) has much smaller effects on S\_w and S\_k. We also find that spectral resolution has a small impact on the moment estimations, and thus on the microphysical interpretation of the drizzle signal. Even the coarsest spectral resolution studied, 0. 08ms\textsuperscript{-1}, seems to be appropriate for calculation moments of drizzling clouds. Moreover, simulations provided additional insight into the microphysical interpretation of the skewness signatures observed: in low (high)-turbulence conditions, only drizzle larger than 20 {$\mu$}m (40 {$\mu$}m) can generate S\_k values above the S\_k noise level (in our case 0.4). Higher S\_k values are also obtained in simulations when smaller beam widths are adopted.},

  abstract = {Light shallow precipitation in the form of drizzle is one of the mechanisms for liquid water removal, affecting cloud lifetime and boundary layer dynamics and thermodynamics. The early formation of drizzle drops is of particular interest for quantifying aerosol\textendash{} cloud\textendash{} precipitation interactions. In models, drizzle initiaion is represented by the autoconversion, that is, the conversion of liquid water from a cloud liquid water category (where particle sedimentation is ignored) into a precipitating liquid water category. Various autoconversion parameterizations have been proposed in recent years, but their evaluation is challenging due to the lack of proper observations of drizzle development in the cloud. This work presents a new algorithm for Classification of Drizzle Stages (CLADS). CLADS is based on the skewness of the Ka-band radar Doppler spectrum. Skewness is sensitive to the drizzle growth in the cloud: the observed Gaussian Doppler spectrum has skewness zero when only cloud droplets are present without any significant fall velocity. Defining downward velocities positive, skewness turns positive when embryonic drizzle forms and becomes negative when drizzle starts to dominate the spectrum. CLADS identifies spatially coherent structures of positive, zero, and negative skewness in space and time corresponding to drizzle seeding, drizzle growth/nondrizzle, and drizzle mature, respectively. We test CLADS on case studies from the J\"ulich Observatory for Cloud Evolution Core Facility (JOYCE-CF) and the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) to quantitatively estimate the benefits of CLADS compared to the standard Cloudnet target categorization algorithm. We suggest that CLADS can provide additional observational constraints for understanding the processes related to drizzle formation better.},

Trade wind cumulus clouds were sampled in the trade wind alley region east of Barbados as well as in the transition region between the trades and the intertropical convergence zone, where the ship crossed some mesoscale oceanic eddies. We collected continuous observations of cloud and precipitation profiles at unprecedented vertical resolution (7\textendash 10 m in the first 3000 m) and high temporal resolution (1\textendash 3 s) using a W-band radar and micro rain radar (MRR), installed on an active stabilization platform to reduce the impact of ship motions on the observations. The paper describes the ship motion correction algorithm applied to the Doppler observations to extract corrected hydrometeor vertical velocities and the algorithm created to filter interference patterns in the MRR observations. Radar reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity, spectral width and skewness for W-band and reflectivity, mean Doppler velocity, and rain rate for MRR are shown for a case study to demonstrate the potential of the high resolution adopted. As non-standard analysis, we also retrieved and provided liquid water path (LWP) from the 89 GHz passive channel available on the W-band radar system.

Spatially adaptive temperature thresholds are implemented for quantifying the mortality risk, and the analysis is conducted for the historical period of 1951\textendash 2005 and two future scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 during the 2006\textendash 2100 period. Results show that the mortality risk will increase in distant future to 8\textendash 20 times higher than that of the historical period if no climate change mitigation is implemented. The coastal regions of the Red sea, Persian Gulf, and Mediterranean Sea indicate substantial increase in mortality risk. Nonetheless, the risk ratio will be limited to 3\textendash 7 times if global warming is limited to 2\,\textdegree C.

The in-situ observations were in close alignment with A-train overpasses for a 30-minute window. For open mesoscale cellular convection (MCC), which was predominantly observed, clouds were commonly found to be intermittently drizzling, patchy and mixed-phase. Compared to the insitu observations of the cloud thermodynamic phase, the CALIOP and MODIS cloud phase optical property products consistently underestimated the occurrence of mixed-phase clouds, whereas the MODIS infrared-based phase product showed a better qualitative agreement despite a frequent classification of uncertainty. The MODIS reff\_2.1 overestimated the in-situ reff for non-drizzling clouds (by 13{$\mu$}m on average) and, to a lesser extent, for lightly drizzling cases. Conversely, MODIS reff\_2.1 underestimated the in-situ reff for heavily drizzling cases by 10{$\mu$}m on average. The overestimation of reff is much greater than that for the stratocumulus over the Southeast Pacific shown in other studies. An examination on sub-pixel heterogeneity, droplet size variability, a bimodal distribution, and solar zenith angle suggests that all of these factors have measurable impacts on the MODIS reff bias. The MODIS Nd is largely consistent with the in-situ observations. However, the Nd of the two high Nd cases (closed MCC) are highly underestimated. An error analysis suggests that the Nd biases are likely a result of a compensating error effect.},

Simulations using the Met Office Unified Model at 2.2, 0.5, and 0.1 km horizontal grid spacing were able to broadly capture the location, timing, and magnitude of the observed velocities, as well as reveal that they are due to small-scale orographic gravity waves resulting from the interaction between the coastal topography and strong easterly winds associated with a synoptic-scale cyclone situated to the north. The simulations indicated that the gravity waves are responsible for (i) temperature fluctuations which coincided with satellite-observed cloud variations in the vicinity of Davis, suggesting that they have a crucial role in the formation of cirrus clouds, and (ii) large vertical momentum fluxes in the troposphere. The waves are prevented from propagating into the stratosphere by the background winds turning from near-surface easterlies to lower stratospheric northerlies. As well as illuminating and quantifying the role that weather systems have in producing orographic gravity waves along the East Antarctic coastline, studies such as this should be exploited to improve the representation of key localized atmospheric processes in global climate models.},

In contrast, global precipitation and evaporation are constrained by the Earth's energy balance to increase at {$\sim$}2\textendash 3\%/\textdegree C. However, this rate of increase is suppressed by rapid atmospheric adjustments in response to greenhouse gases and absorbing aerosols that directly alter the atmospheric energy budget. Rapid adjustments to forcings, cooling effects from scattering aerosol, and observational uncertainty can explain why observed global precipitation responses are currently difficult to detect but are expected to emerge and accelerate as warming increases and aerosol forcing diminishes. Precipitation increases with warming are expected to be smaller over land than ocean due to limitations on moisture convergence, exacerbated by feedbacks and affected by rapid adjustments. Thermodynamic increases in atmospheric moisture fluxes amplify wet and dry events, driving an intensification of precipitation extremes. The rate of intensification can deviate from a simple thermodynamic response due to in-storm and larger-scale feedback processes, while changes in large-scale dynamics and catchment characteristics further modulate the frequency of flooding in response to precipitation increases. Changes in atmospheric circulation in response to radiative forcing and evolving surface temperature patterns are capable of dominating water cycle changes in some regions. Moreover, the direct impact of human activities on the water cycle through water abstraction, irrigation, and land use change is already a significant component of regional water cycle change and is expected to further increase in importance as water demand grows with global population.},

Ten-day backward trajectories clearly indicated the Sahara as the source region of the particles and revealed that the dust layer observed, e.g., over Belsk, Poland, crossed the EARLINET site Aberystwyth, UK, and southern Scandinavia 24\textendash 48 hours before. Lidar-derived particle depolarization ratios, backscatter- and extinction-related \AA ngstr\"om exponents, and extinction-to-backscatter ratios mainly ranged from 15 to 25\%, -0.5 to 0.5, and 40\textendash 80 sr, respectively, within the lofted dust plumes. A few atmospheric model calculations are presented showing the dust concentration over Europe. The simulations were found to be consistent with the network observations.},

The midtropospheric clouds formed in Saharan dust at heights from 3.5 km (-9\textdegree C) to 6.5 km (-27\textdegree C). Distinct ice formation in the altocumulus was triggered by the gravity wave. For the first time, an aerosol/cloud study presents height profiles of temperature, water vapor mixing ratio, relative humidity, dust, and cloud optical properties (volume extinction and backscatter coefficients, lidar ratio, depolarization ratio) within the same air column, solely derived from lidar data. The three gravity-wave-induced clouds did not show any sign of ice formation. The aged dust particles below 4.5-km height were probably partly coated and mixed with hygroscopic material and thus deactivated concerning ice nucleation. Ice crystals were generated in isolated air parcels at the cloud edges of a young, optically thin altocumulus layer between 5- and 6.5-km height. An aged altocumulus deck composed of a geometrically thin liquid water layer at cloud top and an extended ice crystal layer (ice virga) was observed 2 hours later in the same height range. Strong ice formation occurred in the altocumulus during the downdraft induced by the gravity wave. Contact freezing was probably the main reason for the observed ice formation on dust particles. Ice depolarization ratios were relatively low with values from 10 to 15\% in the altocumulus and indicate plate-like crystals.},

Developed from an earlier retrieval that used measurements of radar reflectivity factor together with a priori information about the likely cloud targets, the new retrieval includes temperature information as well to assist in determining the correct region of state space, particularly for those size distribution parameters that are less constrained by the radar measurements. These algorithms have served as the ice cloud retrieval algorithms in Releases 3 and 4 of the CloudSat 2B-CWC-RO Standard Data Product. Several comparison studies have been performed on the previous and current retrieval algorithms: some involving tests of the algorithms on simulated radar data (based on actual cloud probe data or cloud resolving models) and others featuring statistical comparisons of the R04 2B-CWC-RO product (current algorithm) to ice cloud mass retrievals by other spaceborne, airborne, and ground-based instruments or alternative algorithms using the same CloudSat radar data. Comparisons involving simulated radar data based on a database of cloud probe data showed generally good performance, with ice water content (IWC) bias errors estimated to be less than 40\%. Comparisons to ice water content and ice water path estimates by other instruments are mixed. When the comparison is restricted to different retrieval approaches using the same CloudSat radar measurements, CloudSat R04 results generally agree with alternative IWC retrievals for IWC {$<$} 1000 mg m-3 at altitudes below 12 km but differ at higher ice contents and altitudes, either exceeding other retrievals or falling within a spread of retrieval values. Validation and reconciliation of all these approaches will continue to be a topic for further research.},

This network consists of portable, remote-controlled multiwavelength-polarization-Raman lidars (Polly) for automated and continuous 24/7 observations of clouds and aerosols. PollyNET is an independent, voluntary, and scientific network. All Polly lidars feature a standardized instrument design with different capabilities ranging from single wavelength to multiwavelength systems, and now apply unified calibration, quality control, and data analysis. The observations are processed in near-real time without manual intervention, and are presented online at http://polly.tropos.de/. The paper gives an overview of the observations on four continents and two research vessels obtained with eight Polly systems. The specific aerosol types at these locations (mineral dust, smoke, dust-smoke and other dusty mixtures, urban haze, and volcanic ash) are identified by their \AA ngstr\"om exponent, lidar ratio, and depolarization ratio. The vertical aerosol distribution at the PollyNET locations is discussed on the basis of more than 55 000 automatically retrieved 30 min particle backscatter coefficient profiles at 532 nm as this operating wavelength is available for all Polly lidar systems. A seasonal analysis of measurements at selected sites revealed typical and extraordinary aerosol conditions as well as seasonal differences. These studies show the potential of PollyNET to support the establishment of a global aerosol climatology that covers the entire troposphere.},

Deviations in pitch and roll of the instrument with respect to the aircraft's inertial navigation system (INS) must be added to the pitch and roll angles measured by the INS before the radiometric data are corrected for the attitude of the aircraft. For successful determination of the two angles of deviation, a calibration flight must be performed in which the aircraft flies in at least three directions at the same altitude under clear skies and above any haze.},

The representation of vertical wind velocity, W, in atmospheric models constitutes the largest source of uncertainty in the calculation of the cirrus formation rate. Using global atmospheric simulations with a spatial resolution of 7 km we obtain for the first time a direct estimate of the distribution of W at the scale relevant for cirrus formation, validated against long-term observations at two different ground sites. The standard deviation in W, {$\sigma$} w , varies widely over the globe with the highest values resulting from orographic uplift and convection, and the lowest occurring in the Arctic. Globally about 90\% of the simulated {$\sigma$} w values are below 0.1 m s-1 and about one in 104 cloud formation events occur in environments with {$\sigma$} w {$>$} 0.8 m s-1. Combining our estimate with reanalysis products and an advanced cloud formation scheme results in lower homogeneous ice nucleation frequency than previously reported, and a decreasing average ice crystal concentration with decreasing temperature. These features are in agreement with observations and suggest that the correct parameterization of {$\sigma$} w is critical to simulate realistic cirrus properties.},

The data were obtained from a case of semi-transparent cirrus cloud, which occurred north of Scotland during October 2000. The single-scattering models tested are randomly oriented hexagonal ice columns and randomly oriented ice aggregates. High-spectral resolution radiances were measured from above the cirrus at a number of wavelengths between 0.3 and 16.7 \textmu m, thereby covering a large range of ice crystal size parameter space and complex refractive index. It is shown that consistency between retrieved optical thickness and ice crystal effective radius at both solar and infrared wavelengths could only be achieved if the ice aggregate model was assumed. Moreover, differences between the ice aggregate model and spectrally resolved brightness temperature measurements were generally well within {$\pm$}1 K between the wavelengths of 3.3 and 16.0 \textmu m in the clean atmospheric window regions. The paper shows that it is important to have simultaneous radiance measurements from both the solar and thermal spectral regions so that ice crystal scattering models and cirrus retrievals can be rigorously tested.},

In this paper the applicability of an effective-diameter concept at thermal wavelengths (4.0\textendash 30 \textmu m) is further investigated. It is shown that at a wavelength of 8.2 \textmu m the concept begins to break down for small ice crystal effective diameters ({$\leq$}25 \textmu m) and has completely broken down beyond a wavelength of 20 \textmu m. At wavelengths in the far infrared (20\textendash 30 \textmu m) the potential impact of ice crystal geometry and assumed size-distribution shape on brightness-temperature measurements is quantified. It is found that the brightness-temperature difference at a wavelength of 25 \textmu m due to two different populations of ice crystal shapes, but with both populations having the same effective diameter and size-distribution shape, is {$\sim$}5 K. However, if both populations have the same ice crystal shape and effective diameter but different size-distribution shapes, then the brightness-temperature difference is about {$\sim$}9 K at the same wavelength. The impact of size-distribution shape on the brightness-temperature difference is almost twice as great as that of crystal shape. Given that there is sensitivity to the shape of the size-distribution function at far-infrared wavelengths, the potential for retrieving size-distribution shape using far-infrared brightness-temperature measurements is also investigated. The implications of these findings are that the concept of an effective diameter cannot be generally applied at infrared wavelengths unless a priori information is known about the shape of the size-distribution function.},

  abstract = {In this paper a self-consistent scattering model for cirrus is presented. The model consists of an ensemble of ice crystals where the smallest ice crystal is represented by a single hexagonal ice column. As the overall ice crystal size increases, the ice crystals become progressively more complex by arbitrarily attaching other hexagonal elements until a chain-like ice crystal is formed, this representing the largest ice crystal in the ensemble. The ensemble consists of six ice crystal members whose aspect ratios (ratios of the major-to-minor axes of the circumscribed ellipse) are allowed to vary between unity and 1.84 for the smallest and largest ice crystal, respectively. The ensemble model's prediction of parameters fundamental to solar radiative transfer through cirrus such as ice water content and the volume extinction coefficient is tested using in situ based data obtained from the midlatitudes and Tropics. It is found that the ensemble model is able to generally predict the ice water content and extinction measurements within a factor of two. Moreover, the ensemble model's prediction of cirrus spherical albedo and polarized reflection are tested against a space-based instrument using one day of global measurements. The space-based instrument is able to sample the scattering phase function between the scattering angles of approximately 60\textdegree{} and 180\textdegree{} , and a total of 37 581 satellite pixels were used in the present analysis covering latitude bands between 43.75\textdegree S and 76.58\textdegree N. It is found that the ensemble model phase function is well able to minimize significantly differences between satellite-based measurements of spherical albedo and the ensemble model's prediction of spherical albedo. The satellite-based measurements of polarized reflection are found to be reasonably described by more simple members of the ensemble. The ensemble model presented in this paper should find wide applicability to the remote sensing of cirrus as well as more fundamental solar radiative transfer calculations through cirrus, and improved solar optical properties for climate and Numerical Weather Prediction models.},

Cirrus, also referred to as ice crystal clouds, due to their cold temperatures, consist of a variety of non-spherical ice particles which may take on a variety of geometrical forms. These geometrical forms can range from symmetric pristine hexagonal ice columns and plates, single bullets and bullet-rosettes to non-symmetric aggregates of these shapes. These aggregates may also consist of highly complex three-dimensional structures, which may themselves consist of symmetric components. Not only does cirrus consist of a wide variety of shapes but also sizes too, and these sizes can range between {$<$}10 {$\mu$}m to over 1 cm. With such a variety of shapes and sizes predicting the light scattering properties from such an ensemble of ice crystals is the current challenge. This challenge is important to overcome since with cirrus being so high in the Earth's atmosphere it has an important influence on the Earth-atmosphere radiation balance and consequently adds to the uncertainty of predicting climate change. This is why it is important to represent as accurately as possible the single-scattering properties of cirrus ice crystals within general circulation models so that uncertainties in climate change predictions can be reduced. In this review paper the current measurements and observations of ice crystal size and shape are discussed and how these observations relate to current ice crystal models is reviewed. The light scattering properties of the current ice crystal models are also discussed and it is shown how space-based instruments may be used to test these models. The need for particular microphysical and space-based measurements is stressed in order to further constrain ice crystal light scattering models.},

  abstract = {Cirrus is composed of non-spherical ice crystals, and against the blue background of the sky, they appear as tenuous wispy clouds, usually located at altitudes greater than about 6 km. Their spatial and temporal distribution about the Earth's atmosphere is significant. With such distributions, their contributions to the Earth's natural greenhouse effect and hydrological cycle are important. Therefore, it is important that climate models are able to predict the radiative effect of cirrus, as well as their contribution to the total amount of ice mass that occurs in the Earth's atmosphere. However, cirrus is composed of ice crystals that can take on a variety of geometrical shapes, from pristine habits such as hexagonal ice columns, hexagonal ice plates and bullet-rosettes, to highly randomized habits, which may have roughened surfaces and/or air cavities. These habits also aggregate together, to form chains of aggregates and compact aggregates. The sizes of these habits may also vary, from about less than 10 {$\mu$}m, to several cm, with the smaller ice crystals usually existing toward cloud-top and the larger ice crystals existing toward the cloud-bottom. Due to this variability of geometrical complexity, size, and ice mass, predicting the magnitude of the cirrus greenhouse effect has proven problematic. To try to constrain these radiative and hydrological uncertainties, since about 2006 there is now available the A-train constellation of satellites, which attempt to quantify the radiative and hydrological contributions of cirrus to the Earth's atmosphere. The A-train obtains nearly simultaneous measurements of cirrus from across the electromagnetic spectrum. Such simultaneous measurements pose challenges for theoretical scattering models of cirrus, as these models must conserve ice mass and be physically consistent across the electromagnetic spectrum. In this review paper, the microphysical properties of cirrus are summarized. The current idealized habit mixture models that have been proposed to represent the observed variability in ice crystal shape, size and mass are discussed. The theoretical light scattering methods that are currently applied to the idealized habit mixture models to solve for their scattering and absorption properties are discussed. The physical inconsistency of the current approach to parameterize the bulk scattering and absorption properties of cirrus in climate models is highlighted. An alternative parameterization, which couples cloud physics more directly with radiation, is proposed. Such a coupling is required, if climate models are to be physically consistent and radiatively interactive.},

  abstract = {A new coupled cloud physics\textendash radiation parameterization of the bulk optical properties of ice clouds is presented. The parameterization is consistent with assumptions in the cloud physics scheme regarding particle size distributions (PSDs) and mass\textendash dimensional relationships. The parameterization is based on a weighted ice crystal habit mixture model, and its bulk optical properties are parameterized as simple functions of wavelength and ice water content (IWC). This approach directly couples IWC to the bulk optical properties, negating the need for diagnosed variables, such as the ice crystal effective dimension. The parameterization is implemented into the Met Office Unified Model Global Atmosphere 5.0 (GA5) configuration. The GA5 configuration is used to simulate the annual 20-yr shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), as well as the temperature structure of the atmosphere, under various microphysical assumptions. The coupled parameterization is directly compared against the current operational radiation parameterization, while maintaining the same cloud physics assumptions. In this experiment, the impacts of the two parameterizations on the SW and LW radiative effects at TOA are also investigated and compared against observations. The 20-yr simulations are compared against the latest observations of the atmospheric temperature and radiative fluxes at TOA. The comparisons demonstrate that the choice of PSD and the assumed ice crystal shape distribution are as important as each other. Moreover, the consistent radiation parameterization removes a long-standing tropical troposphere cold temperature bias but slightly warms the southern midlatitudes by about 0.5 K.},

  abstract = {The predictive quality of an ensemble model of cirrus ice crystals to model passive and active measurements of ice cloud, from the ultraviolet (UV) to the microwave, is tested. The ensemble model predicts m {$\propto$} D2, where D is the maximum dimension of the ice crystal, and m is its mass. This predicted m-D relationship is applied to a moment estimation parametrization of the particle size distribution (PSD), to estimate the PSD shape, given ice water content (IWC) and in-cloud temperature. The same microphysics is applied across the electromagnetic spectrum to model UV, infrared, microwave and radar observations. The short-wave measurements consist of airborne UV backscatter lidar (light detection and ranging) estimates of the volume extinction coefficient, total solar optical depth, and space-based multi-directional spherical albedo retrievals, at 0.865 \textmu m, between the scattering angles 85\textdegree{} and 125\textdegree. The airborne long-wave measurements consist of high-resolution interferometer upwelling brightness temperatures, obtained between the wavelengths of about 3.45 \textmu m and 4.1 \textmu m, and 8.0 \textmu m to 12.0 \textmu m. The low-frequency measurements consist of ground-based Chilbolton 35 GHz radar reflectivity measurements and space-based upwelling 190 GHz brightness temperature measurements. The predictive quality of the ensemble model is demonstrated to be generally within the experimental uncertainty of the lidar backscatter estimates of the volume extinction coefficient and total solar optical depth. The ensemble model prediction of the high-resolution brightness temperature measurements is generally within {$\pm$}2 K and {$\pm$}1 K at solar and infrared wavelengths, respectively. The 35 GHz radar reflectivity and 190 GHz brightness temperatures are generally simulated to within {$\pm$}2 dBZe, and {$\pm$}2 K, respectively. The directional spherical albedo observations suggest that the scattering phase function of the most randomized ensemble model gives the best fit to the measurements (generally within {$\pm$}3\%). This article demonstrates that the ensemble model, assuming the same microphysics, is physically consistent across the electromagnetic spectrum.},

Such large environmental changes are already having profound impacts on the flora, fauna, and inhabitants of the Arctic region. An open question, however, is whether these Arctic changes have an effect on the jet-stream and thereby influence weather patterns farther south. This broad question has recently received a lot of scientific and media attention, but conclusions appear contradictory rather than consensual. We argue that one point of confusion has arisen due to ambiguities in the exact question being posed. In this study, we frame our inquiries around three distinct questions: Can Arctic warming influence the midlatitude jet-stream? Has Arctic warming significantly influenced the midlatitude jet-stream? Will Arctic warming significantly influence the midlatitude jet-stream? We argue that framing the discussion around the three questions: Can it?, Has it?, and Will it? provides insight into the common themes emerging in the literature as well as highlights the challenges ahead.},

  abstract = {Abstract Mixed-phase layer clouds are radiatively important and their correct representation in numerical models of the atmosphere is needed for both weather forecasts and climate prediction. In particular, midlevel mixed-phase layer clouds (altocumulus) are often poorly predicted. Here the representation of altocumulus cloud in five operational models and the ERA-Interim reanalysis is evaluated using ground-based remote sensors. All models are found to underestimate the supercooled liquid water content by at least a factor of 2. The models with the most sophisticated microphysics (separate prognostic variables for liquid and ice) had least supercooled liquid of all models, though they could simulate the correct liquid-over-ice structure of individual clouds. To investigate the reasons for the lack of predicted supercooled liquid water, a single-column model (EMPIRE) was developed incorporating the relevant physical processes for altocumulus cloud. The supercooled liquid water was found to be the most sensitive to factors that significantly affect the glaciation rate, including aspects of the ice microphysics formulation, as well as the model vertical resolution. Using observations to improve the ice particle size distribution formulation and the parametrization of ice cloud fraction also lead to a significant increase in supercooled liquid water in the simulated clouds. The study highlights the main parameterized processes that need careful attention in large-scale models in order to adequately represent the liquid phase in mixed-phase layer clouds. In Part 2, the reason for the sensitivity to vertical resolution is investigated and a new parameterization for models with coarse vertical resolution is proposed.},

  abstract = {We have identified a region of an ice cloud where a sharp transition of dual-wavelength ratio occurs at a fixed height for longer than 20 min. In this paper we provide evidence that rapid aggregation of ice particles occurred in this region, creating large particles. This evidence comes from triple-wavelength Doppler spectrum radar data that were fortuitously being collected. Through quantitative comparison of the Doppler spectra from the three radars we are able to estimate the ice particle size distribution (of particles larger than 0.75 mm) at different heights in the cloud. This allows us to investigate the evolution of the ice particle size distribution and determine whether the evolution is consistent with aggregation, riming or vapour deposition. The newly developed method allows us to isolate the signal from the larger (non-Rayleigh scattering) particles in the distribution. Therefore, a particle size distribution retrieval is possible in areas of the cloud where the dual-wavelength ratio method would fail because the bulk dual-wavelength ratio value is too close to zero. The ice particles grow rapidly from a maximum size of 0.75 to 5 mm while falling less than 500 m in under 10 min. This rapid growth is shown to agree well with theoretical estimates of aggregation, with aggregation efficiency being approximately 0.7, and is inconsistent with other growth processes, e.g. growth by vapour deposition or riming. The aggregation occurs in the middle of the cloud and is not present throughout the entire lifetime of the cloud. However, the layer of rapid aggregation is very well defined at a constant height, where the temperature is -15 {$\circ$}C and lasts for at least 20 min (approximate horizontal distance: 24 km). Immediately above this layer, the radar Doppler spectrum is bi-modal, which signals the formation of new small ice particles at that height. We suggest that these newly formed particles, at approximately -15 {$\circ$}C, grow dendritic arms, enabling them to easily interlock and accelerate the aggregation process. The large estimated aggregation efficiency in this cloud is consistent with recent laboratory studies for dendrites at this temperature.},

Observations of the microphysical, dynamical and radiative processes that act at cloud scales are needed to improve our understanding of clouds.

However, there are still gaps in our ability to probe clouds due to large uncertainties in the retrievals. The present work discusses the potential of G band (frequency between 110 and 300 GHz) Doppler radars in combination with lower frequencies to further improve the retrievals of microphysical properties. Our results show that, thanks to a larger dynamic range in dual-wavelength re?ectivity, dual-wavelength attenuation and dual-wavelength Doppler velocity (with respect to a Rayleigh reference), the inclusion of frequencies in the G band can signi?cantly improve current pro?ling capabilities in three key areas: boundary layer clouds, cirrus and mid-level ice clouds, and precipitating snow.},

  abstract = {CloudSat observations are used in combination with collocated European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis to simulate spaceborne W-band Doppler observations from slant-looking radars. The simulator also includes cross-polarization effects which are relevant if the Doppler velocities are derived from polarization diversity pulse pair correlation. A speci?c conically scanning radar con?guration (WIVERN), recently proposed to the ESA-Earth Explorer 10 call that aims to provide global in-cloud winds for data assimilation, is analysed in detail in this study. One hundred granules of CloudSat data are exploited to investigate the impact on Doppler velocity estimates from three speci?c effects: (1) non-uniform beam ?lling, (2) wind shear and (3) crosstalk between orthogonal polarization channels induced by hydrometeors and surface targets. Errors associated with non-uniform beam ?lling constitute the most important source of error and can account for almost 1 m s ?1 standard deviation, but this can be reduced effectively to less than 0.5 m s ?1 by adopting corrections based on estimates of vertical re?ectivity gradients. Wind-shear-induced errors are generally much smaller (? 0.2 m s ?1 ). A methodology for correcting these errors has been developed based on estimates of the vertical wind shear and the re?ectivity gradient. Low signal-to-noise ratios lead to higher random errors (especially in winds) and therefore the correction (particularly the one related to the wind-shear-induced error) is less effective at low signal-to-noise ratio. Both errors can be underestimated in our model because the CloudSat data do not fully sample the spatial variability of the re?ectivity ?elds, whereas the ECMWF reanalysis may have smoother velocity ?elds than in reality (e.g. they underestimate vertical wind shear). The simulator allows for quanti?cation of the average number of accurate measurements that could be gathered by the Doppler radar for each polar orbit, which is strongly impacted by the selection of the polarization diversity H ? V pulse separation, T hv . For WIVERN a selection close to 20 \dbend s (with a corresponding folding velocity equal to 40 m s ?1 ) seems to achieve the right balance between maximizing the number of accurate wind measurements (exceeding 10 \% of the time at any particular level in the mid-troposphere) and minimizing aliasing effects in the presence of high winds. The study lays the foundation for future studies towards a thorough assessment of the performance of polar orbiting wide-swath W-band Doppler radars on a global scale. The next generation of scanning cloud radar systems and reanalyses with improved resolution will enable a full capture of the spatial variability of the cloud re?ectivity and the in-cloud wind ?elds, thus re?ning the results of this study.},

Airborne sampling instrumentation includes the two-dimensional cloud (2D-C), two-dimensional precipitation (2D-P), high-volume precipitation spectrometer (HVPS), cloud particle imager (CPI), and NCAR video ice particle sampler (VIPS) probes. Herein the development of a comprehensive set of microphysical models based on in situ measurements of particle size distributions (PSDs) is discussed. Two parameters are developed and examined: ice water content (IWC) and median mass diameter Dm. Comparisons are provided between the IWC and Dm values derived from in situ measurements obtained during a series of field campaigns held in the midlatitude and tropical regions and those calculated from a set of modeled ice particles used for light-scattering calculations. The ice particle types considered in this study include droxtals, hexagonal plates, solid columns, hollow columns, aggregates, and 3D bullet rosettes. It is shown that no single habit accurately replicates the derived IWC and Dm values, but a mixture of habits can significantly improve the comparison of these bulk microphysical properties. In addition, the relationship between Dm and the effective particle size Deff, defined as 1.5 times the ratio of ice particle volume to projected area for a given PSD, is investigated. Based on these results, a subset of microphysical models is chosen as the basis for the development of ice cloud bulk scattering models in Part II of this study.},

The primary focus is to develop band-averaged models appropriate for use by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) imager on the Earth Observing System Terra and Aqua platforms, specifically for bands located at wavelengths of 0.65, 1.64, 2.13, and 3.75 {$\mu$}m. The results indicate that there are substantial differences in the bulk scattering properties of ice clouds formed in areas of deep convection and those that exist in areas of much lower updraft velocities. Band-averaged bulk scattering property results obtained from a particle-size-dependent mixture of ice crystal habits are compared with those obtained assuming only solid hexagonal columns. The single-scattering albedo is lower for hexagonal columns than for a habit mixture for the 1.64-, 2.13-, and 3.75-{$\mu$}m bands, with the differences increasing with wavelength. In contrast, the asymmetry factors obtained from the habit mixture and only the solid hexagonal column are most different at 0.65 {$\mu$}m, with the differences decreasing as wavelength increases. At 3.75 {$\mu$}m, the asymmetry factor results from the two habit assumptions are almost indistinguishable. The asymmetry factor, single-scattering albedo, and scattering phase functions are also compared with the MODIS version-1 (V1) models. Differences between the current and V1 models can be traced to the microphysical models and specifically to the number of both the smallest and the largest particles assumed in the size distributions.},

  abstract = {This study reports on the development of bulk single-scattering models for ice clouds that are appropriate for use in hyperspectral radiative transfer cloud modeling over the spectral range from 100 to 3250 cm-1. The models are developed in a manner similar to that recently reported for the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS); therefore these models result in a consistent set of scattering properties from visible to far-infrared wavelengths. The models incorporate a new database of individual ice-particle scattering properties that includes droxtals, 3D bullet rosettes, hexagonal solid and hollow columns, aggregates, and plates. The database provides single-scattering properties for each habit in 45 size bins ranging from 2 to 9500 {$\mu$}m, and for 49 wavenumbers between 100 and 3250 cm-1, which is further interpolated to 3151 discrete wavenumbers on the basis of a third-order spline interpolation method. Bulk models are developed by integrating various properties over both particle habit and size distributions. Individual bulk models are developed for 18 effective diameters Deff, ranging from Deff = 10 {$\mu$}m to Deff = 180 {$\mu$}m. A total of 1117 particle size distributions are used in the analyses and are taken from analysis of the First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Regional Experiment (FIRE)-I, FIRE-II, Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program intensive operation period (ARM-IOP), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Kwajalein Experiment (TRMM-KWAJEX), and Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers Florida-Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) data. The models include microphysical and scattering properties such as median mass diameter, effective diameter, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry factor, and scattering phase function. The spectral models are appropriate for applications involving the interpretation of the radiometric measurements of ice clouds acquired by infrared spectrometers such as the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) on the NASA Aqua satellite and the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) on the upcoming National Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) platforms.},

  abstract = {Abstract This study summarizes recent improvements in the development of bulk scattering/absorption models at solar wavelengths. The approach combines microphysical measurements from various field campaigns with single-scattering properties for nine habits including droxtals, plates, solid/hollow columns, solid/hollow bullet rosettes, and several types of aggregates. Microphysical measurements are incorporated from a number of recent field campaigns in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere. A set of 12 815 particle size distributions is used for which Tcld {$\leq$} -40\textdegree C. The ice water content in the microphysical data spans six orders of magnitude. For evaluation, a library of ice-particle single-scattering properties is employed for 101 wavelengths between 0.4 and 2.24 {$\mu$}m. The library includes the full phase matrix as well as properties for smooth, moderately roughened, and severely roughened particles. Habit mixtures are developed for generalized cirrus, midlatitude cirrus, and deep tropical convection. The single-scattering properties are integrated over particle size and wavelength using an assumed habit mixture to develop bulk scattering and absorption properties. In comparison with global Cloud Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) data, models built with severely roughened particles compare best for all habit mixtures. The assumption of smooth particles provided the largest departure from CALIOP measurements. The use of roughened rather than smooth particles to infer optical thickness and effective diameter from satellite imagery such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) will result in a decrease in optical thickness and an increase in particle size.},

The methodology for deriving these optical models is based on microphysical data from 11 field campaigns using a variety of in situ probes, and incorporates a correction to mitigate the impact of ice particles that shatter at the probe inlets. The models are also based on a new library of ice habit single scattering properties developed for plates, droxtals, hollow and solid columns, hollow and solid bullet rosettes, an aggregate of solid columns, and a small/large aggregate of plates. Three sets of models are developed that assume the use of solid columns only, the aggregate of solid columns only, and a general habit mixture that incorporates all the habits. The consistency of the resulting models is explored. While the general habit mixture provides consistency with in situ microphysical measurements and the closest agreement with polarized reflectivities observed by the POLDER instrument on the PARASOL satellite, the aggregate of severely roughened solid columns provides the closest agreement between solar and infrared optical thicknesses. Finally, spectral results are presented for the shortwave and longwave models.},

The surface CRE quantifies the potential of clouds to modify the radiative energy budget at the surface and is calculated by combining broadband radiation measurements during low-level flight sections in mostly cloudy conditions with radiative transfer simulations of cloud-free conditions. The significance of surface albedo changes due to the presence of clouds is demonstrated, and this effect is considered in the cloud-free simulations. The observations are discussed with respect to differences of the CRE between sea ice and open-ocean surfaces and between the seasonally different campaigns. The results indicate that the CRE depends on cloud, illumination, surface, and thermodynamic properties. The solar and thermal-infrared (TIR) components of the CRE, CREsol and CRETIR, are analysed separately, as well as combined for the study of the total CRE (CREtot). The inter-campaign differences of CREsol are dominated by the seasonal cycle of the solar zenith angle, with the strongest cooling effect in summer. The lower surface albedo causes a stronger solar cooling effect over open ocean than over sea ice, which amounts to -259 W m-2 (-108 W m-2) and -65 W m-2 (-17 W m-2), respectively, during summer (spring). Independent of campaign and surface type, CRETIR is only weakly variable and shows values around 75 W m-2. In total, clouds show a negative CREtot over open ocean during all campaigns. In contrast, over sea ice, the positive CREtot suggests a warming effect of clouds at the surface, which neutralizes during mid-summer. Given the seasonal cycle of the sea ice distribution, these results imply that clouds in the Fram Strait region cool the surface during the sea ice minimum in late summer, while they warm the surface during the sea ice maximum in spring.},

The climatology provides monthly mean 1\texttimes 1\textdegree{} CDNC values plus associated uncertainties over the global ice-free oceans. All values are in-cloud values, i.e. the reported CDNC value will be valid for the cloudy part of the grid box. Here, we provide an overview of how the climatology was generated and assess and quantify potential systematic error sources including effects of broken clouds, and remaining artefacts caused by the retrieval process or related to observation geometry. Retrievals and evaluations were performed at the scale of initial MODIS observations (in contrast to some earlier climatologies, which were created based on already gridded data). This allowed us to implement additional screening criteria, so that observations inconsistent with key assumptions made in the CDNC retrieval could be rejected. Application of these additional screening criteria led to significant changes in the annual cycle of CDNC in terms of both its phase and magnitude. After an optimal screening was established a final CDNC climatology was generated. Resulting CDNC uncertainties are reported as monthly-mean standard deviations of CDNC over each 1\texttimes 1\textdegree{} grid box. These uncertainties are of the order of 30\% in the stratocumulus regions and 60 to 80\% elsewhere.},

  abstract = {Polarimetric radar-based hydrometeor classification is the procedure of identifying different types of hydrometeors by exploiting polarimetric radar observations. The main drawback of the existing supervised classification methods, mostly based on fuzzy logic, is a significant dependency on a presumed electromagnetic behaviour of different hydrometeor types. Namely, the results of the classification largely rely upon the quality of scattering simulations. When it comes to the unsupervised approach, it lacks the constraints related to the hydrometeor microphysics. The idea of the proposed method is to compensate for these drawbacks by combining the two approaches in a way that microphysical hypotheses can, to a degree, adjust the content of the classes obtained statistically from the observations. This is done by means of an iterative approach, performed offline, which, in a statistical framework, examines clustered representative polarimetric observations by comparing them to the presumed polarimetric properties of each hydrometeor class. Aside from comparing, a routine alters the content of clusters by encouraging further statistical clustering in case of non-identification. By merging all identified clusters, the multi-dimensional polarimetric signatures of various hydrometeor types are obtained for each of the studied representative datasets, i.e. for each radar system of interest. These are depicted by sets of centroids which are then employed in operational labelling of different hydrometeors. The method has been applied on three C-band datasets, each acquired by different operational radar from the MeteoSwiss Rad4Alp network, as well as on two X-band datasets acquired by two research mobile radars. The results are discussed through a comparative analysis which includes a corresponding supervised and unsupervised approach, emphasising the operational potential of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {The equilibrium climate sensitivity of Earth is defined as the global mean surface air temperature increase that follows a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide. For decades, global climate models have predicted it as between approximately 2 and 4.5 \textdegree C. However, a large subset of models participating in the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project predict values exceeding 5 \textdegree C. The difference has been attributed to the radiative effects of clouds, which are better captured in these models, but the underlying physical mechanism and thus how realistic such high climate sensitivities are remain unclear. Here we analyse Community Earth System Model simulations and find that, as the climate warms, the progressive reduction of ice content in clouds relative to liquid leads to increased reflectivity and a negative feedback that restrains climate warming, in particular over the Southern Ocean. However, once the clouds are predominantly liquid, this negative feedback vanishes. Thereafter, other positive cloud feedback mechanisms dominate, leading to a transition to a high-sensitivity climate state. Although the exact timing and magnitude of the transition may be model dependent, our findings suggest that the state dependence of the cloud-phase feedbacks is a crucial factor in the evolution of Earth's climate sensitivity with warming.},

To develop such understanding, new perspectives are needed to provide details on the vertical structure and spatial variability of key atmospheric properties, along with information over difficult-to-reach surfaces such as newly forming sea ice. Over the last three years, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has supported various flight campaigns using unmanned aircraft systems [UASs, also known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones] and tethered balloon systems (TBSs) at Oliktok Point, Alaska. These activities have featured in situ measurements of the thermodynamic state, turbulence, radiation, aerosol properties, cloud microphysics, and turbulent fluxes to provide a detailed characterization of the lower atmosphere. Alongside a suite of active and passive ground-based sensors and radiosondes deployed by the DOE Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program through the third ARM Mobile Facility (AMF-3), these flight activities demonstrate the ability of such platforms to provide critically needed information. In addition to providing new and unique datasets, lessons learned during initial campaigns have assisted in the development of an exciting new community resource.},

It was found that when the difference between the sun azimuth angle and the aircraft heading is near either 0\textdegree{} or 180\textdegree, special care has to be taken in interpreting the incoming flux, as it is enhanced by a few percent due to reflections off elements of the aircraft frame.},

The other main modification was implemented in the snow parameterisation by replacing the constant intercept parameter to a temperature dependent intercept parameter. These microphysics modifications are evaluated in detail in three case studies (one stratiform and two convective cases) by comparing the modelled and observed reflectivity and precipitation data. Comparisons to weather radar reflectivity data show that especially light to moderate precipitation forecast ({$<$} 20 dB) is improved. For the evaluation of the modelled precipitation, weather radar and rain gauge data are combined in order to get spatially high resolution data of high accuracy. For the quality analysis, the new error measure SAL (analysis of structure, amplitude and location) is used. The results show that the new microphysics formulations improve the precipitation amplitude forecast of up to 50\% for the convective cases while the forecast for the stratiform case is not improved.},

The agreement between the derived {$\epsilon$} estimates is examined at the cloud base height of stratiform warm clouds. Collocated {$\epsilon$} estimates based on power spectra analysis of DRV and DLV measurements show good agreement (correlation coefficient of 0.86 and 0.78 for both cases analyzed here) during both drizzling and nondrizzling conditions. This suggests that unified (below and above cloud base) time-height estimates of {$\epsilon$} in cloud-topped boundary layer conditions can be produced. This also suggests that eddy dissipation rate can be estimated throughout the cloud layer without the constraint that clouds need to be nonprecipitating. Eddy dissipation rate estimates based on DRW measurements compare well with the estimates based on Doppler velocity but their performance deteriorates as precipitation size particles are introduced in the radar volume and broaden the DRW values. Based on this finding, a methodology to estimate the Doppler spectra broadening due to the spread of the drop size distribution is presented. The uncertainties in {$\epsilon$} introduced by signal-to-noise conditions, the estimation of the horizontal wind, the selection of the averaging time window, and the presence of precipitation are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {An aerosol climatology to represent aerosols in the radiation schemes of global atmospheric models was recently developed. We derived the climatology from a reanalysis of atmospheric composition produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). As an example of an application in a global atmospheric model, we discuss the technical aspects of the implementation in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (ECMWF-IFS) and the impact of the new climatology on the medium-range weather forecasts and 1-year simulations. The new aerosol climatology was derived by combining a set of model simulations with constrained meteorological conditions and an atmospheric composition reanalysis for the period 2003\textendash 2013 produced by the IFS. The aerosol fields of the reanalysis are constrained by assimilating the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) retrievals product by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments. In a further step, we used modelled aerosol fields to correct the aerosol speciation and the vertical profiles of the aerosol reanalysis fields. The new climatology provides the monthly-mean mass mixing ratio of five aerosol species constrained by assimilated MODIS AOT. Using the new climatology in the ECMWF-IFS leads to changes in the direct aerosol radiative effect compared to the climatology previously implemented, which have a small but non-impact on the forecast skill of large-scale weather patterns in the medium-range. However, details of the regional distribution of aerosol radiative forcing can have a large local impact. This is the case for the area of the Arabian Peninsula and the northern Indian Ocean.

  abstract = {Abstract The plane-parallel model for the parameterization of clouds in global climate models is examined in order to estimate the effects of the vertical profile of the microphysical parameters on radiative transfer calculations for extended boundary layer clouds. The vertically uniform model is thus compared to the adiabatic stratified one. The validation of the adiabatic model is based on simultaneous measurements of cloud microphysical parameters in situ and cloud radiative properties from above the cloud layer with a multispectral radiometer. In particular, the observations demonstrate that the dependency of cloud optical thickness on cloud geometrical thickness is larger than predicted with the vertically uniform model and that it is in agreement with the prediction of the adiabatic one. Numerical simulations of the radiative transfer have been performed to establish the equivalence between the two models in terms of the effective radius. They show that the equivalent effective radius of a vertically uniform model is between 80\% and 100\% of the effective radius at the top of an adiabatic stratified model. The relationship depends, in fact, upon the cloud geometrical thickness and droplet concentration. Remote sensing measurements of cloud radiances in the visible and near infrared are then examined at the scale of a cloud system for a marine case and the most polluted case sampled during the second Aerosol Characterization Experiment. The distributions of the measured values are significantly different between the two cases. This constitutes observational evidence of the aerosol indirect effect at the scale of a cloud system. Finally, the adiabatic stratified model is used to develop a procedure for the retrieval of cloud geometrical thickness and cloud droplet number concentration from the measurements of cloud radiances. It is applied to the marine and to the polluted cases. The retrieved values of droplet concentration are significantly underestimated with respect to the values measured in situ. Despite this discrepancy the procedure is efficient at distinguishing the difference between the two cases.},

On this day a persistent thin cirrus layer, with mostly clear skies underneath, was detected in real time by the cloud lidar on the ER-2, and the aircraft was directed to profile down through the SVC. Measurements of the net broadband infrared irradiance and spectrally integrated solar irradiance above, below, and through the SVC are used to determine the infrared and solar heating rates of the cloud. The lidar measurements show that the variable SVC layer was located between {$\sim$}13 and 15 km. Its midvisible optical depth varied from 0.01 to 0.10 with a mean of 0.034 {$\pm$} 0.033. Its depolarization ratio was approximately 0.4, indicative of ice clouds. From the divergence of the measured net irradiances the infrared heating rate of the SVC was determined to be {$\sim$}2.50\textendash 3.24 K d-1 and the solar heating rate was found to be negligible. These values are consistent with previous indirect observations of other SVC and with model-generated heating rates of SVC with similar optical depths. This study illustrates the utility and potential of the profiling sampling strategy employed here. A more fully instrumented high-altitude aircraft that also included in situ cloud and aerosol probes would provide a comprehensive data set for characterizing both the radiative and microphysical properties of these ubiquitous tropical clouds.},

We simulate a cold frontal rainband from the Aerosol Properties, PRocesses, And In?uenceS on the Earth?s Climate campaign and investigate the impact of the new parameterizations on the simulated ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC) and precipitation. Near the convective regions of the rainband, contributions to ICNC can be as large from secondary production as from primary nucleation, but ICNCs greater than 50 L ?1 remain underestimated by the model. The addition of the secondary production parameterizations also clearly intensi?es the differences in both accumulated precipitation and precipitation rate between the convective towers and non-convective gap regions. We suggest, then, that secondary ice production parameterizations be included in large-scale models on the basis of large hydrometeor concentration and convective activity criteria.},

Two-year-averaged daytime TOA CRF is estimated to be between -1.08 and 0.78 W{$\cdot$}m-2 (from -0.49 to 1.10 W{$\cdot$}m-2 in 2017, and from -1.67 to 0.47 W{$\cdot$}m-2 in 2018). This subarctic study completes a now trilogy of MPLNET ground-based cloud forcing investigations, following midlatitude and tropical studies by Campbell et al. at Greenbelt, Maryland, and Lolli et al. at Singapore. Campbell et al. hypothesize a global meridional daytime TOA CRF gradient that begins as positive at the equator (2.20\textendash 2.59 W{$\cdot$}m-2 over land and from -0.46 to 0.42 W{$\cdot$}m-2 over ocean at Singapore), becomes neutral in the midlatitudes (0.03\textendash 0.27 W{$\cdot$}m-2 over land in Maryland), and turns negative moving poleward. This study does not completely confirm Campbell et al., as values are not found as exclusively negative. Evidence in historical reanalysis data suggests that daytime cirrus forcing in and around the subarctic likely once was exclusively negative. Increasing tropopause heights, inducing higher and colder cirrus, have likely increased regional forcing over the last 40 years. We hypothesize that subarctic interannual cloud variability is likely a considerable influence on global cirrus cloud forcing sensitivity, given the irregularity of polar versus midlatitude synoptic weather intrusions. This study and hypothesis lay the basis for an extrapolation of these MPLNET experiments to satellite-based lidar cirrus cloud datasets.},

Emphasis is placed on analysis of the action of atmospheric waves on the O3 distribution. In particular, the model generates the medium-scale waves which are often observed in the southern hemisphere. These waves tend to form quasi-regular O3 patterns with zonal wave numbers 4, 5, and 6, in fairly good agreement with the observations. Baroclinic instability generates the waves in the lower troposphere, but it is their equivalent barotropic structure in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere which produces the signal on the total ozone column, since O3 disturbances are nearly in phase in this altitude range. Episodes of large amplitude of the medium-scale waves occur when the transient waves interact with a stationary wave. This standing wave has a zonal wave number close to 4 and appears to result from the large convective activity within the South Pacific Convergence Zone and its southward extension at mid-latitudes. This study gives a good illustration of the important role played by GCMs in understanding the interactions between dynamical and physical processes in the troposphere and wave activity and O3 distribution in the lower stratosphere.},

  abstract = {This article describes the validation of a linear parameterization of the ozone photochemistry for use in upper tropospheric and stratospheric studies. The present work extends a previously developed scheme by improving the 2-D model used to derive the coefficients of the parameterization. The chemical reaction rates are updated from a compilation that includes recent laboratory work. Furthermore, the polar ozone destruction due to heterogeneous reactions at the surface of the polar stratospheric clouds is taken into account as a function of the stratospheric temperature and the total chlorine content.   Two versions of the parameterization are tested. The first one only requires the solution of a continuity equation for the time evolution of the ozone mixing ratio, the second one uses one additional equation for a cold tracer. The parameterization has been introduced into the chemical transport model MOCAGE. The model is integrated with wind and temperature fields from the ECMWF operational analyses over the period 2000\&ndash;2004. Overall, the results from the two versions show a very good agreement between the modelled ozone distribution and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) satellite data and the "in-situ" vertical soundings. During the course of the integration the model does not show any drift and the biases are generally small, of the order of 10\%. The model also reproduces fairly well the polar ozone variability, notably the formation of "ozone holes" in the Southern Hemisphere with amplitudes and a seasonal evolution that follow the dynamics and time evolution of the polar vortex.   The introduction of the cold tracer further improves the model simulation by allowing additional ozone destruction inside air masses exported from the high to the mid-latitudes, and by maintaining low ozone content inside the polar vortex of the Southern Hemisphere over longer periods in spring time.   It is concluded that for the study of climate scenarios or the assimilation of ozone data, the present parameterization gives a valuable alternative to the introduction of detailed and computationally costly chemical schemes into general circulation models.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review We assess the current understanding of the state and behaviour of aerosols under pre-industrial conditions and the importance for climate. Recent Findings Studies show that the magnitude of anthropogenic aerosol radiative forcing over the industrial period calculated by climate models is strongly affected by the abundance and properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere. The low concentration of aerosol particles under relatively pristine conditions means that global mean cloud albedo may have been twice as sensitive to changes in natural aerosol emissions under pre-industrial conditions compared to present-day conditions. Consequently, the discovery of new aerosol formation processes and revisions to aerosol emissions have large effects on simulated historical aerosol radiative forcing. Summary We review what is known about the microphysical, chemical, and radiative properties of aerosols in the pre-industrial atmosphere and the processes that control them. Aerosol properties were controlled by a combination of natural emissions, modification of the natural emissions by human activities such as land-use change, and anthropogenic emissions from biofuel combustion and early industrial processes. Although aerosol concentrations were lower in the pre-industrial atmosphere than today, model simulations show that relatively high aerosol concentrations could have been maintained over continental regions due to biogenically controlled new particle formation and wildfires. Despite the importance of pre-industrial aerosols for historical climate change, the relevant processes and emissions are given relatively little consideration in climate models, and there have been very few attempts to evaluate them. Consequently, we have very low confidence in the ability of models to simulate the aerosol conditions that form the baseline for historical climate simulations. Nevertheless, it is clear that the 1850s should be regarded as an early industrial reference period, and the aerosol forcing calculated from this period is smaller than the forcing since 1750. Improvements in historical reconstructions of natural and early anthropogenic emissions, exploitation of new Earth system models, and a deeper understanding and evaluation of the controlling processes are key aspects to reducing uncertainties in future.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present the latest refinements brought to the DARDAR-CLOUD product, which contains ice cloud microphysical properties retrieved from the cloud radar and lidar measurements from the A-Train mission. Based on a large dataset of in situ ice cloud measurements, the parameterizations used in the microphysical model of the algorithm \textendash{} i.e. the normalized particle size distribution, the mass\textendash size relationship, and the parameterization of the a priori value of the normalized number concentration as a function of temperature \textendash{} were assessed and refined to better fit the measurements, keeping the same formalism as proposed in DARDAR basis papers. Additionally, in regions where lidar measurements are available, the lidar ratio retrieved for ice clouds is shown to be well constrained by the lidar\textendash radar synergy. Using this information, the parameterization of the lidar ratio was also refined, and the new retrieval equals on average 35{$\pm$}10\&thinsp;sr in the temperature range between -60 and -20\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C. The impact of those changes on the retrieved ice cloud properties is presented in terms of ice water content (IWC) and effective radius. Overall, IWC values from the new DARDAR-CLOUD product are on average 16\&thinsp;\% smaller than the previous version, leading to a 24\&thinsp;\% reduction in the ice water path. In parallel, the retrieved effective radii increase by 5\&thinsp;\% to 40\&thinsp;\%, depending on temperature and the availability of the instruments, with an average difference of +15\&thinsp;\%. Modifications of the microphysical model strongly affect the ice water content retrievals with differences that were found to range from -50\&thinsp;\% to +40\&thinsp;\%, depending on temperature and the availability of the instruments. The largest differences are found for the warmest temperatures (between -20 and 0\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C) in regions where the cloud microphysical processes are more complex and where the retrieval is almost exclusively based on radar-only measurements. The new lidar ratio values lead to a reduction of IWC at cold temperatures, the difference between the two versions increasing from around 0\&thinsp;\% at -30\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C to 70\&thinsp;\% below -80\&thinsp;{$\circ$}C, whereas effective radii are not impacted.},

  abstract = {Abstract The ratio of liquid water to ice in a cloud, largely controlled by the presence of ice nuclei and cloud temperature, alters cloud radiative effects. This study quantitatively examines how the liquid fraction of clouds influences various climate feedbacks using the NCAR Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). Climate feedback parameters were calculated using equilibrated temperature changes in response to increases in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in CAM Version 3.0 with a slab ocean model. Two sets of model experiments are designed such that cloud liquid fraction linearly decreases with a decrease in temperature down to -20\textdegree C (Experiment ``C20'') and -40\textdegree C (Experiment ``C40''). Thus, at the same subzero temperature, C20 yields fewer liquid droplets (and more ice crystals) than C40. Comparison of the results of experiments C20 and C40 reveals that experiment C20 is characterized by stronger cloud and temperature feedbacks in the tropics (30\textdegree N\textendash 30\textdegree S) (by 0.25 and -0.28 W m-2 K-1, respectively) but weaker cloud, temperature, and albedo feedbacks (by -0.20, 0.11, and -0.07 W m-2 K-1) in the extratropics. Compensation of these climate feedback changes leads to a net climate feedback change of 7.28\% of that of C40 in the model. These results suggest that adjustment of the cloud phase function affects all types of feedbacks (with the smallest effect on water vapor feedback). Although the net change in total climate feedback is small due to the cancellation of positive and negative individual feedback changes, some of the individual changes are relatively large. This illustrates the importance of the influence of cloud phase partitioning for all major climate feedbacks, and by extension, for future climate change predictions.},

During the winter months of increased anthropogenic pollution we observe smaller sizes of cloud droplets in water clouds in agreement with the expected aerosol indirect effect. However, contrary to our expectations, we find that during episodes of increased pollution the effective radius of ice crystals is shifted toward the larger rather than smaller sizes. We propose a combination of natural seasonal variability of meteorological conditions and an ``inverse aerosol indirect effect'' caused by heterogeneous ice nucleation as a possible explanation of observed ice crystal growth. The ECHAM4 (European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecast Hamburg version 4th generation GCM) results with heterogeneous ice nucleation reproduce the observed increase in ice crystal size during the enhanced pollution episodes.},

  abstract = {The Arctic has warmed more than twice as fast as the global average since the mid 20th century, a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification (AA). These profound changes to the Arctic system have coincided with a period of ostensibly more frequent events of extreme weather across the Northern Hemisphere (NH) mid-latitudes, including extreme heat and rainfall events and recent severe winters. Though winter temperatures have generally warmed since 1960 over mid-to-high latitudes, the acceleration in the rate of warming at high-latitudes, relative to the rest of the NH, started approximately in 1990. Trends since 1990 show cooling over the NH continents, especially in Northern Eurasia. The possible link between Arctic change and mid-latitude climate and weather has spurred a rush of new observational and modeling studies. A number of workshops held during 2013-2014 have helped frame the problem and have called for continuing and enhancing efforts for improving our understanding of Arctic-mid-latitude linkages and its attribution to the occurrence of extreme climate and weather events. Although these workshops have outlined some of the major challenges and provided broad recommendations, further efforts are needed to synthesize the diversified research results to identify where community consensus and gaps exist. Building upon findings and recommendations of the previous workshops, the US CLIVAR Working Group on Arctic Change and Possible Influence on Mid-latitude Climate and Weather convened an international workshop at Georgetown University in Washington, DC, on February 1-3, 2017. Experts in the fields of atmosphere, ocean, and cryosphere sciences assembled to assess the rapidly evolving state of understanding, identify consensus on knowledge and gaps in research, and develop specific actions to accelerate progress within the research community. With more than 100 participants, the workshop was the largest and most comprehensive gathering of climate scientists to address the topic to date. In this white paper, we synthesize and discuss outcomes from this workshop and activities involving many of the working group members.},

Quite often the spectra are contaminated by a wide variety of sources, including (but not limited to) birds, aircraft, velocity and range folding, radio frequency interference, and ground clutter. These contamination sources can vary in space, time, and even in their basic characteristics. Human experts analyzing Doppler spectra can often identify the desired atmospheric signal among the contamination. However, it is quite difficult to build automated algorithms that can approach the skill of the human expert. The method described here relies on mathematical analyses, fuzzy logic synthesis, and global image processing algorithms to mimic the human expert. Fuzzy logic is a very simple, robust, and efficient technique that is well suited to this type of feature extraction problem. These new moment estimation algorithms were originally designed for boundary layer wind profilers; however, they are quite general and have wide applicability to any device that measures Doppler spectra as a function of range (e.g., lidars, sodars, and weather radars).},

The infrared cloud radiative effect (CRE) at the surface is modulated by cloud properties; however, CRE also depends on humidity because clouds emit at wavelengths that are semi-transparent to greenhouse gases, most notably water vapour. Here we show how temperature and humidity control CRE through competing influences between the mid- and far-infrared. At constant relative humidity, CRE does not decrease with increasing temperature/absolute humidity as expected, but rather is found to be approximately constant for temperatures characteristic of the Arctic. This stability is disrupted if relative humidity varies. Our findings explain observed seasonal and regional variability in Arctic CRE of order 10 Wm\^-2 . With the physical properties of Arctic clouds held constant, we calculate recent increases in CRE of 1-5 Wm\^-2 in autumn and winter, which are projected to reach 5-15 Wm\^-2 by 2050, implying increased sensitivity of the surface to clouds.},

In remote regions such as the Arctic, aerosol\textendash{} cloud interactions are severely understudied yet may have significant implications for the surface energy budget and its impact on sea ice and snow surfaces. Further, uncertainties in model representations of heterogeneous ice nucleation are a significant hindrance to simulating Arctic mixed-phase cloud processes. We present results from a campaign called INPOP (Ice Nucleating Particles at Oliktok Point), which took place at a US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (DOE ARM) facility in the northern Alaskan Arctic. Three time- and size-resolved aerosol impactors were deployed from 1 March to 31 May 2017 for offline ice nucleation and chemical analyses and were co-located with routine measurements of aerosol number and size. The largest particles (i.e., \textbackslash geq3\textmu{} m or ``coarse mode'') were the most efficient INPs by inducing freezing at the warmest temperatures. During periods with snow- and ice-covered surfaces, coarse mode INP concentrations were very low (maximum of 6\texttimes{} 10\textbackslash textsuperscript-4L\textbackslash textsuperscript-1 at -15\textbackslash textsuperscript\textbackslash circC), but higher concentrations of warm-temperature INPs were observed during late May (maximum of 2\texttimes{} 10\textbackslash textsuperscript-2L\textbackslash textsuperscript-1 at -15\textbackslash textsuperscript\textbackslash circC). These higher concentrations were attributed to air masses originating from over open Arctic Ocean water and tundra surfaces. To our knowledge, these results represent the first INP characterization measurements in an Arctic oilfield location and demonstrate strong influences from mineral and marine sources despite the relatively high springtime pollution levels. Ultimately, these results can be used to evaluate the anthropogenic and natural influences on aerosol composition and Arctic cloud properties.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Arctic aerosols have been targeted in studies for decades due to their consequential impacts on the energy budget, both directly and indirectly through their ability to modulate cloud microphysics. Even with the breadth of knowledge afforded from these previous studies, aerosols and their effects remain poorly quantified, especially in the rapidly changing Arctic. Additionally, many previous studies involved use of ground-based measurements, and due to the frequent stratified nature of the Arctic atmosphere, brings into question the representativeness of these datasets aloft. Here, we report on airborne observations from the US Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Fifth Airborne Carbon Measurements (ACME-V) field campaign along the North Slope of Alaska during the summer of 2015. Contrary to previous evidence that the Alaskan Arctic summertime air is relatively pristine, we show how local oil extraction activities, 2015's central Alaskan wildfires, and, to a lesser extent, long-range transport introduce aerosols and trace gases higher in concentration than previously reported in Arctic haze measurements to the North Slope. Although these sources were either episodic or localized, they serve as abundant aerosol sources that have the potential to impact a larger spatial scale after emission.},

Measurements of the hygroscopic properties of aerosols are crucial for accurately representing their relationship with clouds, which can be a significant source of uncertainty in assessing direct and indirect radiative effects. The ability for lidar to retrieve measurements of the vertically resolved f (RH), that is, the aerosol extinction at some wet RH normalized by the aerosol extinction at a dry reference RH, is investigated here and compared with nephelometer-measured f (RH) at the surface. We introduce a modified approach to fitting the lidar measurements of aerosol extinction and our comparisons reveal that lidar and nephelometer measurements of f (RH) are consistent, both with each other and with reported values in the literature. The implications for this work present a path forward for global-scale retrievals of remotely sensed aerosol hygroscopic properties. Most importantly, the efforts in this study could lead to closing the gap on uncertainties associated with the aerosol indirect radiative effect when combined with inversion retrievals of aerosol microphysical properties.},

  abstract = {Testud et al. (2001) have recently developed a formalism, known as the ``normalized particle size distribution (PSD)'', which consists in scaling the diameter and concentration axes in such a way that the normalized PSDs are independent of water content and mean volume-weighted diameter. In this paper we investigate the statistical properties of the normalized PSD for the particular case of ice clouds, which are known to play a crucial role in the Earth's radiation balance. To do so, an extensive database of airborne in situ microphysical measurements has been constructed. A remarkable stability in shape of the normalized PSD is obtained. The impact of using a single analytical shape to represent all PSDs in the database is estimated through an error analysis on the instrumental (radar reflectivity and attenuation) and cloud (ice water content, effective radius, terminal fall velocity of ice crystals, visible extinction) properties. This resulted in a roughly unbiased estimate of the instrumental and cloud parameters, with small standard deviations ranging from 5 to 12\%. This error is found to be roughly independent of the temperature range. This stability in shape and its single analytical approximation implies that two parameters are now sufficient to describe any normalized PSD in ice clouds: the intercept parameter N*0 and the mean volume-weighted diameter Dm. Statistical relationships (parameterizations) between N*0 and Dm have then been evaluated in order to reduce again the number of unknowns. It has been shown that a parameterization of N*0 and Dm by temperature could not be envisaged to retrieve the cloud parameters. Nevertheless, Dm-T and mean maximum dimension diameter -T parameterizations have been derived and compared to the parameterization of Kristj\'ansson et al. (2000) currently used to characterize particle size in climate models. The new parameterization generally produces larger particle sizes at any temperature than the Kristj\'ansson et al. (2000) parameterization. These new parameterizations are believed to better represent particle size at global scale, owing to a better representativity of the in situ microphysical database used to derive it. We then evaluated the potential of a direct N*0-Dm relationship. While the model parameterized by temperature produces strong errors on the cloud parameters, the N*0-Dm model parameterized by radar reflectivity produces accurate cloud parameters (less than 3\% bias and 16\% standard deviation). This result implies that the cloud parameters can be estimated from the estimate of only one parameter of the normalized PSD (N*0 or Dm) and a radar reflectivity measurement.},

The forward model includes effects such as non-Rayleigh scattering by the radar and molecular and multiple scattering by the lidar. By rigorous treatment of errors and a careful choice of state variables and associated a priori estimates, a seamless retrieval is possible between regions of the cloud detected by both radar and lidar and regions detected by just one of these two instruments. Thus, when the lidar signal is unavailable (for reasons such as strong attenuation), the retrieval tends toward an empirical relationship using radar reflectivity factor and temperature, and when the radar signal is unavailable (such as in optically thin cirrus), accurate retrievals are still possible from the combination of lidar and radiometer. The method is tested first on simulated profiles from aircraft data and then on real observations taken in West Africa. It would be straightforward to expand the approach to include other measurements simply by including a forward model for them.},

The method allows a seamless retrieval between regions where both radar and lidar are sensitive to the regions where one detects the cloud. We first implement a cloud phase identification method, including identification of supercooled water layers using the lidar signal and temperature to discriminate ice from liquid. We also include rigorous calculation of errors assigned in the variational scheme. We estimate the impact of the microphysical assumptions on the algorithm when radiances are not assimilated by evaluating the impact of the change in the area-diameter and the density-diameter relationships in the retrieval of cloud properties. We show that changes to these assumptions affect the radar-only and lidar-only retrieval more than the radar-lidar retrieval, although the lidar-only extinction retrieval is only weakly affected. We also show that making use of the molecular lidar signal beyond the cloud as a constraint on optical depth, when ice clouds are sufficiently thin to allow the lidar signal to penetrate them entirely, improves the retrieved extinction. When infrared radiances are available, they provide an extra constraint and allow the extinction-to-backscatter ratio to vary linearly with height instead of being constant, which improves the vertical distribution of retrieved cloud properties.},

In this article, we evaluate the ice water content (IWC) and ice cloud fraction statistical distributions from the numerical weather prediction models of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and the UK Met Office, exploiting the synergy between the CloudSat radar and CALIPSO lidar. Using the last three weeks of July 2006, we analyse the global ice cloud occurrence as a function of temperature and latitude and show that the models capture the main geographical and temperature-dependent distributions, but overestimate the ice cloud occurrence in the Tropics in the temperature range from -60 \textdegree C to -20 \textdegree C and in the Antarctic for temperatures higher than -20 \textdegree C, but underestimate ice cloud occurrence at very low temperatures. A global statistical comparison of the occurrence of grid-box mean IWC at different temperatures shows that both the mean and range of IWC increases with increasing temperature. Globally, the models capture most of the IWC variability in the temperature range between -60 \textdegree C and -5 \textdegree C, and also reproduce the observed latitudinal dependencies in the IWC distribution due to different meteorological regimes. Two versions of the ECMWF model are assessed. The recent operational version with a diagnostic representation of precipitating snow and mixed-phase ice cloud fails to represent the IWC distribution in the -20 \textdegree C to 0 \textdegree C range, but a new version with prognostic variables for liquid water, ice and snow is much closer to the observed distribution. The comparison of models and observations provides a much-needed analysis of the vertical distribution of IWC across the globe, highlighting the ability of the models to reproduce much of the observed variability as well as the deficiencies where further improvements are required.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$><$}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{$>$}Abstract.{$<$}/strong{$>$} Despite their proven significance for the atmospheric radiative energy budget, the effect of cirrus on climate and the magnitude of their modification by human activity is not well quantified. Besides anthropogenic pollution sources on the ground, aviation has a large local effect on cirrus microphysical and radiative properties via the formation of contrails and their transition to contrail cirrus. To investigate the anthropogenic influence on natural cirrus, we compare the microphysical properties of cirrus measured at mid-latitude regions (ML, \&lt; 60\&deg; N) that are often affected by aviation and pollution with cirrus measured in the same season in comparatively pristine high latitudes (HL, \&ge; 60\&deg; N). The number concentration, effective diameter, and ice water content of the observed cirrus are derived from in situ measurements covering ice crystal sizes between between 2 and 6400 \&micro;m collected during the CIRRUS-HL campaign (CIRRUS in High Latitudes) in June and July 2021. We analyse the dependence of cirrus microphysical properties on altitude and latitude and demonstrate that the median ice number concentration is by an order of magnitude larger in the measured mid-latitude cirrus with 0.0086 cm\textsuperscript{-3} compared to 0.001 cm\textsuperscript{-3} in high-latitude cirrus. Ice crystals in mid-latitude cirrus are on average smaller than in high-latitude cirrus, with a median effective diameter of 165 \&micro;m compared to 210 \&micro;m and the median ice water content in mid-latitude cirrus is higher (0.0033 g m\textsuperscript{-3}) than in high-latitude cirrus (0.0019 g m\textsuperscript{-3}). In order to investigate the cirrus properties in relation to the region of formation, we combine the airborne observations with 10-day backward trajectories to identify the location of cirrus formation and the cirrus type: in situ or liquid origin cirrus, depending on whether there is only ice or also liquid water present in the cirrus history, respectively. The cirrus formed and measured at mid-latitudes (M-M) have particularly high ice number concentration and low effective diameter. This is very likely a signature of contrails and contrail cirrus, which is often observed in the in situ origin cirrus type. In contrast, the largest effective diameter and lowest number concentration were found in the cirrus formed and measured at high latitudes (H-H) along with the highest relative humidity over ice (RH\textsubscript{i}). On average, in-cloud RH\textsubscript{i} was above saturation in all cirrus. While most of the H-H cirrus were of in situ origin, the cirrus formed at mid-latitudes and measured at high latitudes (M-H) were mainly of liquid origin. A pristine Arctic background atmosphere with scarce availability of ice nuclei and the extended growth of few nucleated ice crystals may explain the observed RH\textsubscript{i} and size distributions. The M-H cirrus are a mixture of the properties of M-M and H-H cirrus (preserving some of the initial properties acquired at mid-latitudes and transforming under Arctic atmospheric conditions). Our analyses indicate that part of the cirrus found at high latitudes are actually formed at mid-latitudes, and therefore affected by mid-latitude air masses, which have a greater anthropogenic influence.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Ice first forms in clouds warmer than -36 C on particles termed ice nuclei.

This new relationship reduces unexplained variability in ice nuclei concentrations at a given temperature from 10\^3 to less than a factor of 10, with the remaining variability apparently due to variations in aerosol chemical composition or other factors. When implemented in a global climate model, the new parameterization strongly alters cloud liquid and ice water distributions compared to the simple, temperature-only parameterizations currently widely used. The revised treatment indicates a global net cloud radiative forcing increase of 1 W m-2 for each order of magnitude increase in ice nuclei concentrations, demonstrating the strong sensitivity of climate simulations to assumptions regarding the initiation of cloud glaciation.},

The predicted absorption spectra agree (to first order in interaction energy) with exciton theory in the limit of weak coupling, with the hypochromism theory of Tinoco and Rhodes, and (for a classical oscillator model) with exciton theory for strong coupling.

Using crystal aspect ratios greater than unity generally leads to ensemble-average values of aspect ratio that are inconsistent with the ensemble-average asymmetry parameters. When a definition of aspect ratio is used that limits the aspect ratio to below unity for both hexagonal plates and columns, the effective asymmetry parameters calculated using ensemble-average aspect ratios are generally consistent with ensemble-average asymmetry parameters, especially if aspect ratios are geometrically averaged. Ensemble-average distortion parameters generally also yield effective asymmetry parameters that are largely consistent with ensemble-average asymmetry parameters. In the case of mixtures of plates and columns, it is recommended to geometrically average the aspect ratios and to subsequently calculate the effective asymmetry parameter using a column or plate geometry when the contribution by columns to a given mixture's total projected area is greater or less than 50\%, respectively. In addition, it is shown that ensemble-average aspect ratios, distortion parameters, and asymmetry parameters can generally be retrieved accurately from simulated multidirectional polarization measurements based on mixtures of varying columns and plates. However, such retrievals tend to be somewhat biased toward yielding columnlike aspect ratios. Furthermore, generally large retrieval errors can occur for mixtures with approximately equal contributions of columns and plates and for ensembles with strong contributions of thin plates.},

Low ice extent in September is generally preceded by a summer with decreased middle and precipitating clouds. Following a low-ice September there is enhanced low cloud cover in autumn.

In total, clouds were present 72\% of the time, with multi-layer mixed phase (28.4\%) and single-layer water clouds (11.3\%) occurring most frequently. A comparison with the Cloudnet sites Chilbolton and Lindenberg for the same time period revealed that the Murg Valley exhibits lower liquid water paths (LWPs; median = 37.5 g m-2) compared to the two sites located in flat terrain. In order to evaluate the derived thermodynamic and cloud property profiles, a radiative closure study was performed with independent surface radiation measurements. In clear sky, average differences between calculated and observed surface fluxes are less than 2\% and 4\% for the short wave and long wave part, respectively. In cloudy situations, differences between simulated and observed fluxes, particularly in the short wave part, are much larger, but most of these can be related to broken cloud situations. The daytime cloud radiative effect (CRE), i.e. the difference of cloudy and clear-sky net fluxes, has been analysed for the whole nine-month period. For overcast, single-layer water clouds, sensitivity studies revealed that the CRE uncertainty is likewise determined by uncertainties in liquid water content and effective radius. For low LWP clouds, CRE uncertainty is dominated by LWP uncertainty; therefore refined retrievals, such as using infrared and/or higher microwave frequencies, are needed.

  abstract = {For the first time, the cloud radiative effect (CRE) has been characterized for the Arctic site Ny-Alesund including more than 2 years of data (June 2016 - September 2018). The cloud radiative effect, i.e. the difference between the all-sky and equivalent clear-sky net fluxes, has been derived based on a combination of ground-based remote sensing observations of cloud properties and the application of broadband radiative transfer simulations. The simulated fluxes have been first evaluated in terms of a radiative closure study. A good agreement with observed surface downward fluxes has been found with only small biases for clear-sky and cloudy situations. Differences are slightly larger under cloudy conditions. However, when moving to monthly averages, uncertainties in the CRE are estimated to be small. At Ny-Alesund, the monthly net surface CRE is positive from September to April/May and negative in summer. When averaging over a year, an overall surface warming effect by clouds of 12 W m-2 has been found. The longwave surface CRE of liquidcontaining cloud is mainly driven by liquid water path (LWP) with an asymptote value of 75 W m-2 , while the shortwave surface CRE can largely be explained by LWP, solar zenith angle and surface albedo. Liquid-containing clouds (LWP {$>$} 5 g m-2) clearly contribute most to the shortwave surface CRE (70-98\%) and from late spring to autumn also to the longwave surface CRE (up to 95\%). Only in winter, ice clouds (IWP {$>$} 0 g m-2 , LWP {$<$} 5 g m-2) are equally important or may even dominate the signal in the longwave surface CRE.},

Five spectral intervals in the shortwave and five intervals in the infrared are employed, with the ice cloud optical properties parameterized in terms of ice water path (IWP) and the effective radius (re) of the ice crystal size distribution. The parameterization thus allows the flexibility of varying the ice water path and effective radius independently of each other. The parameterized optical properties are used to calculate the bulk reflectivity, transmissivity, and emissivity for cirrus clouds with realistic ranges of IWP and re. For a given change in cloud optical depth a change in re alone is more effective than a change in IWP alone in altering the shortwave reflectivity and therefore in altering the strength of the cloud albedo feedback.},

  abstract = {A one-dimensional thermodynamic model of sea ice is presented that focuses on those features that are most relevant to interactions with the atmosphere, namely the surface albedo and leads. It includes a surface albedo parameterization that interacts strongly with the state of the surface, and explicitly includes meltwater ponds. The lead parameterization contains a minimum lead fraction, absorption of solar radiation in and below the leads, lateral accretion and ablation of the sea ice, and a prescribed sea ice divergence rate. The model performed well in predicting the current climatic sea ice conditions in the central Arctic when compared with observations and other theoretical calculations. Results of parameter sensitivity tests produced large equilibrium ice thicknesses for small values of ice divergence or large values of minimum lead fraction as a result of positive feedback mechanisms involving cooling of water in the leads. The ice thickness was also quite sensitive to the meltwater runoff fraction and moderately sensitive to the other parameters in the melt pond parameterization, a result of the strong dependence of the surface albedo, and hence the net flux, on the surface conditions. To further investigate the physical interactions and internal feedback processes governing the sea ice-lead system, sensitivity tests were also performed for each of the external forcing variables. The model's equilibrium sea ice thickness was extremely sensitive to changes in the downward longwave and shortwave fluxes and atmospheric temperature and humidity, moderately sensitive to the value of the ocean heat flux, and insensitive to values of wind speed, snowfall, and rainfall in the immediate vicinity of the baseline forcing, although significant changes in thickness occurred for larger variations in wind speed and snowfall. Four important positive feedback loops were identified and described: (1) the surface albedo feedback, (2) the conduction feedback, (3) the lead solar flux feedback, and (4) the lead fraction feedback. The destabilizing effects of these positive feedbacks were mitigated by two strong negative feedbacks: (1) the outgoing longwave flux feedback, and (2) the turbulent flux feedback. Considering the strong influence which sea ice has on global atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, it is essential that climate models be able to treat these feedback processes appropriately.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive new radiation code based on the two-stream equations in both the long-wave and short-wave spectral regions is described. The spectral resolution of the code is variable, enabling it to be used in a wide range of applications. Because of its flexibility, the code is well-suited to the investigation of the sensitivity of radiative calculations to changes in the way in which physical processes are parametrized. The gaseous transmission data are derived from a line-by-line model. Particular attention is directed towards the treatment of the water vapour continuum, the overlap between gases, and the sensitivity to changing the carbon dioxide concentrations. The performance of the code is examined both at high spectral resolution and in a lower-resolution configuration designed for the UK Meteorological Office Unified Forecast/Climate Model (UM). Particularly for use in the UM, the code must be shown to perform satisfactorily across the whole range of atmospheric conditions. Comparisons are therefore made with reference calculations in both the long-wave and the short-wave, in clear and cloudy skies, and the accuracy with which various processes may be represented is studied. For the cloudy calculations in the short-wave, a new method is presented for deriving the single-scattering properties in broad bands, based on the analytic expression for the reflectivity of an optically thick cloud. This minimizes the errors in calculating the short-wave radiative properties of water clouds when the spectral resolution is reduced to that designed for the UM. In contrast, for ice clouds the errors are minimized by deriving the single-scattering properties using linear averaging, as appropriate for optically thin clouds. In the long-wave, the vertical distribution of the radiative heating in cirrus clouds is examined at high spectral resolution. The effect of scattering of long-wave radiation, usually ignored in large-scale models, is examined in some detail and is explained using a simple model. Taking all these studies into account, it is concluded that the configuration designed for the UM retains the generality of the code, without significantly compromising the overall accuracy.},

The clouds formed in a cold air outbreak over the open Greenland Sea. Beside the predominant mixed-phase clouds pure liquid water and ice clouds were observed. Utilizing measurements of solar radiation reflected by the clouds three methods to retrieve the thermodynamic phase of the cloud are introduced and compared. Two ice indices IS and IP were obtained by analyzing the spectral pattern of the cloud top reflectance in the near infrared (1500\textendash 1800 nm wavelength) spectral range which is characterized by ice and water absorption. While IS analyzes the spectral slope of the reflectance in this wavelength range, IS utilizes a principle component analysis (PCA) of the spectral reflectance. A third ice index IA is based on the different side scattering of spherical liquid water particles and nonspherical ice crystals which was recorded in simultaneous measurements of spectral cloud albedo and reflectance. Radiative transfer simulations show that IS, IP and IA range between 5 to 80, 0 to 8 and 1 to 1.25 respectively with lowest values indicating pure liquid water clouds and highest values pure ice clouds. The spectral slope ice index IS and the PCA ice index IP are found to be strongly sensitive to the effective diameter of the ice crystals present in the cloud. Therefore, the identification of mixed-phase clouds requires a priori knowledge of the ice crystal dimension. The reflectance-albedo ice index IA is mainly dominated by the uppermost cloud layer ({$\tau<$}1.5). Therefore, typical boundary-layer mixed-phase clouds with a liquid cloud top layer will be identified as pure liquid water clouds. All three methods were applied to measurements above a cloud field observed during ASTAR 2007. The comparison with independent in situ microphysical measurements shows the ability of the three approaches to identify the ice phase in Arctic boundary-layer clouds.},

  abstract = {Broadband solar and terrestrial irradiance measurements of high temporal resolution are needed to study inhomogeneous clouds or surfaces and to derive vertical profiles of heating/cooling rates at cloud top. An efficient method to enhance the temporal resolution of slow-response measurements of broadband terrestrial irradiance using pyrgeometer is introduced. It is based on the deconvolution theorem of Fourier transform to restore amplitude and phase shift of high frequent fluctuations. It is shown that the quality of reconstruction depends on the instrument noise, the pyrgeometer response time and the frequency of the oscillations. The method is tested in laboratory measurements for synthetic time series including a boxcar function and periodic oscillations using a CGR-4 pyrgeometer with response time of 3 s. The originally slow-response pyrgeometer data were reconstructed to higher resolution and compared to the predefined synthetic time series. The reconstruction of the time series worked up to oscillations of 0.5 Hz frequency and 2 W m-2 amplitude if the sampling frequency of the data acquisition is 16 kHz or higher. For oscillations faster than 2 Hz, the instrument noise exceeded the reduced amplitude of the oscillations in the measurements and the reconstruction failed. The method was applied to airborne measurements of upward terrestrial irradiance from the VERDI (Vertical Distribution of Ice in Arctic Clouds) field campaign. Pyrgeometer data above open leads in sea ice and a broken cloud field were reconstructed and compared to KT19 infrared thermometer data. The reconstruction of amplitude and phase shift of the deconvoluted data improved the agreement with the KT19 data. Cloud top temperatures were improved by up to 1 K above broken clouds of 80\textendash 800 m size (1\textendash 10 s flight time) while an underestimation of 2.5 W m-2 was found for the upward irradiance over small leads of about 600 m diameter (10 s flight time) when using the slow-response data. The limitations of the method with respect to instrument noise and digitalization of measurements by the data acquisition are discussed.},

The objective of ACLOUD was to study Arctic boundary layer and mid-level clouds and their role in Arctic amplification. Two research aircraft (Polar 5 and 6) jointly performed 22 research flights over the transition zone between open ocean and closed sea ice. Both aircraft were equipped with identical instrumentation for measurements of basic meteorological parameters, as well as for turbulent and radiative energy fluxes. In addition, on Polar 5 active and passive remote sensing instruments were installed, while Polar 6 operated in situ instruments to characterize cloud and aerosol particles as well as trace gases. A detailed overview of the specifications, data processing, and data quality is provided here. It is shown that the scientific analysis of the ACLOUD data benefits from the coordinated operation of both aircraft. By combining the cloud remote sensing techniques operated on Polar 5, the synergy of multi-instrument cloud retrieval is illustrated. The remote sensing methods were validated using truly collocated in situ and remote sensing observations. The data of identical instruments operated on both aircraft were merged to extend the spatial coverage of mean atmospheric quantities and turbulent and radiative flux measurement. Therefore, the data set of the ACLOUD campaign provides comprehensive in situ and remote sensing observations characterizing the cloudy Arctic atmosphere. All processed, calibrated, and validated data are published in the World Data Center PANGAEA as instrument-separated data subsets (Ehrlich et al., 2019b, https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.902603).},

Two sets of pyranometers and pyrgeometers are mounted to measure upward and downward solar (0.3\textendash 3 \textmu m) and thermal\textendash infrared (3\textendash 100 \textmu m) irradiances. The radiometers are installed in a passively ventilated fairing to reduce the effects of the dynamic environment, e.g., fast changes in altitude and temperature. The remaining thermal effects range up to 20 W m-2 for the pyranometers and 10 W m-2 for the pyrgeometers. Using data collected by BACARDI during a night flight, it is demonstrated that the dynamic components of the offsets can be parameterized by the rate of change of the radiometer sensor temperatures, providing a greatly simplifying correction of the dynamic thermal effects. The parameterization provides a linear correction function (200\textendash 500 W m-2 K-1 s) that depends on the radiometer type and the mounting position of the radiometer on HALO. Furthermore, BACARDI measurements from the EUREC4A (Elucidating the Role of Clouds\textemdash Circulation Coupling in Climate) field campaign are analyzed to characterize the performance of the radiometers and to evaluate all corrections applied in the data processing. Vertical profiles of irradiance measurements up to 10 km altitude show that the thermal offset correction limits the bias due to temperature changes to values below 10 W m-2. Measurements with BACARDI during horizontal, circular flight patterns in cloud-free conditions demonstrate that the common geometric attitude correction of the solar downward irradiance provides reliable measurements in this typical flight section of EUREC4A, even without active stabilization of the radiometer.},

Satellite sources include SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, SSMIS, AMSR-2, and GMI. To mitigate spurious CLWP trends, the climatology is corrected for drifting satellite overpass times by simultaneously solving for the monthly average CLWP and the monthly mean diurnal cycle. In addition to a longer record and six additional satellite products, major enhancements relative to the UWisc climatology include updating the input to version 7 RSS retrievals, correcting for a CLWP bias (based on matchups to clear-sky MODIS scenes), and constructing a total (cloud + rain) liquid water path (TLWP) record for use in analyses of columnar liquid water in raining clouds. Because the microwave emission signal from cloud water is similar to that of precipitation-sized hydrometeors, greater uncertainty in the CLWP record is expected in regions of substantial precipitation. Therefore, the TLWP field can also be used as a quality-control screen, where uncertainty increases as the ratio of CLWP to TLWP decreases. For regions where confidence in CLWP is highest (i.e., CLWP:TLWP {$>$} 0.8), systematic differences in MAC CLWP relative to UWisc CLWP range from -15\% (e.g., global oceanic stratocumulus decks) to +5\%\textendash 10\% (e.g., portions of the higher latitudes, storm tracks, and shallower convection regions straddling the ITCZ).

Issues were found with driver training, mental model development, mode confusion, unexpected mode interactions, SA, and susceptibility to distraction.

  abstract = {The new spectrometer of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS) is a multipurpose hyperspectral cloud and sky imager designated, but is not limited to investigations of cloud\textendash aerosol interactions in Earth's atmosphere. With its high spectral and spatial resolution, the instrument is designed to measure solar radiation in the visible and shortwave infrared region that is reflected from, or transmitted through clouds and aerosol layers. It is based on two hyperspectral cameras that measure in the solar spectral range between 400 and 2500 nm with a spectral bandwidth between 2.5 and 12.0 nm. The instrument was operated in ground-based campaigns as well as aboard the German High Altitude LOng Range (HALO) research aircraft, e.g., during the ACRIDICON-CHUVA campaign in Brazil during summer 2014. This paper describes the specMACS instrument hardware and software design and characterizes the instrument performance. During the laboratory characterization of the instrument, the radiometric response as well as the spatial and spectral resolution was assessed. Since the instrument is primarily intended for retrievals of atmospheric quantities by inversion of radiative models using measured radiances, a focus is placed on the determination of its radiometric response. Radiometric characterization was possible for both spectrometers, with an absolute accuracy of 3 \% at their respective central wavelength regions. First measurements are presented which demonstrate the wide applicability of the instrument. They show that key demands are met regarding the radiometric and spectral accuracy which is required for the intended remote sensing techniques.},

  abstract = {This study gives a summary of lessons learned during the absolute calibration of the airborne, high-power Ka-band cloud radar HAMP MIRA on board the German research aircraft HALO. The first part covers the internal calibration of the instrument where individual instrument components are characterized in the laboratory. In the second part, the internal calibration is validated with external reference sources like the ocean surface backscatter and different air- and spaceborne cloud radar instruments. A key component of this work was the characterization of the spectral response and the transfer function of the receiver. In a wide dynamic range of 70 dB, the receiver response turned out to be very linear (residual 0.05 dB). Using different attenuator settings, it covers a wide input range from -105 to -5 dBm. This characterization gave valuable new insights into the receiver sensitivity and additional attenuations which led to a major improvement of the absolute calibration. The comparison of the measured and the previously estimated total receiver noise power (-95.3 vs. -98.2 dBm) revealed an underestimation of 2.9 dB. This underestimation could be traced back to a larger receiver noise bandwidth of 7.5 MHz (instead of 5 MHz) and a slightly higher noise figure (1.1 dB). Measurements confirmed the previously assumed antenna gain (50.0 dBi) with no obvious asymmetries or increased side lobes. The calibration used for previous campaigns, however, did not account for a 1.5 dB two-way attenuation by additional waveguides in the airplane installation. Laboratory measurements also revealed a 2 dB higher two-way attenuation by the belly pod caused by small deviations during manufacturing. In total, effective reflectivities measured during previous campaigns had to be corrected by +7.6 dB. To validate this internal calibration, the well-defined ocean surface backscatter was used as a calibration reference. With the new absolute calibration, the ocean surface backscatter measured by HAMP MIRA agrees very well ({$<$} 1 dB) with modeled values and values measured by the GPM satellite. As a further cross-check, flight experiments over Europe and the tropical North Atlantic were conducted. To that end, a joint flight of HALO and the French Falcon 20 aircraft, which was equipped with the RASTA cloud radar at 94 GHz and an underflight of the spaceborne CloudSat at 94 GHz were performed. The intercomparison evealed lower reflectivities (-1.4 dB) for RASTA but slightly higher reflectivities (+1.0 dB) for CloudSat. With effective reflectivities between RASTA and CloudSat and the good agreement with GPM, the accuracy of the absolute calibration is estimated to be around 1 dB.},

  abstract = {Ice clouds and their effect on earth's radiation budget are one of the largest sources of uncertainty in climate change predictions. The uncertainty in predicting ice cloud feedbacks in a warming climate arises due to uncertainties in measuring and explaining their current optical and microphysical properties as well as from insufficient knowledge about their spatial and temporal distribution. This knowledge can be significantly improved by active remote sensing, which can help to explore the vertical profile of ice cloud microphysics, such as ice particle size and ice water content. This study focuses on the well-established variational approach VarCloud to retrieve ice cloud microphysics from radar\textendash lidar measurements.  While active backscatter retrieval techniques surpass the information content of most passive, vertically integrated retrieval techniques, their accuracy is limited by essential assumptions about the ice crystal shape. Since most radar\textendash lidar retrieval algorithms rely heavily on universal mass\textendash size relationships to parameterize the prevalent ice particle shape, biases in ice water content and ice water path can be expected in individual cloud regimes. In turn, these biases can lead to an erroneous estimation of the radiative effect of ice clouds. In many cases, these biases could be spotted and corrected by the simultaneous exploitation of measured solar radiances.  The agreement with measured solar radiances is a logical prerequisite for an accurate estimation of the radiative effect of ice clouds. To this end, this study exploits simultaneous radar, lidar, and passive measurements made on board the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft. By using the ice clouds derived with VarCloud as an input to radiative transfer calculations, simulated solar radiances are compared to measured solar radiances made above the actual clouds. This radiative closure study is done using different ice crystal models to improve the knowledge of the prevalent ice crystal shape. While in one case aggregates were capable of reconciling radar, lidar, and solar radiance measurements, this study also analyses a more problematic case for which no radiative closure could be achieved. In this case, collocated in situ measurements indicate that the lack of closure may be linked to unexpectedly high values of the ice crystal number density.},

  abstract = {By coordinating the design and distribution of global climate model simulations of the past, current, and future climate, the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) has become one of the foundational elements of climate science. However, the need to address an ever-expanding range of scientific questions arising from more and more research communities has made it necessary to revise the organization of CMIP. After a long and wide community consultation, a new and more federated structure has been put in place. It consists of three major elements: (1) a handful of common experiments, the DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) and CMIP historical simulations (1850\textendash near present) that will maintain continuity and help document basic characteristics of models across different phases of CMIP; (2) common standards, coordination, infrastructure, and documentation that will facilitate the distribution of model outputs and the characterization of the model ensemble; and (3) an ensemble of CMIP-Endorsed Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs) that will be specific to a particular phase of CMIP (now CMIP6) and that will build on the DECK and CMIP historical simulations to address a large range of specific questions and fill the scientific gaps of the previous CMIP phases. The DECK and CMIP historical simulations, together with the use of CMIP data standards, will be the entry cards for models participating in CMIP. Participation in CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs by individual modelling groups will be at their own discretion and will depend on their scientific interests and priorities. With the Grand Science Challenges of the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) as its scientific backdrop, CMIP6 will address three broad questions:   \&ndash; How does the Earth system respond to forcing?  \&ndash; What are the origins and consequences of systematic model biases?   \&ndash; How can we assess future climate changes given internal climate variability, predictability, and uncertainties in scenarios?  This CMIP6 overview paper presents the background and rationale for the new structure of CMIP, provides a detailed description of the DECK and CMIP6 historical simulations, and includes a brief introduction to the 21 CMIP6-Endorsed MIPs.},

  abstract = {In this article, we discuss the shape of ice water content (IWC) vertical profiles in high ice clouds and its effect on their radiative properties, both in short- and in long-wave bands (SW and LW). Based on the analysis of collocated satellite data, we propose a minimal set of primitive shapes (rectangular, isosceles trapezoid, lower and upper triangle), which represents the IWC profiles sufficiently well. About 75 \% of all high-level ice clouds (P {$<$} 440 hPa) have an ice water path (IWP) smaller than 100 g m-2, with a 10 \% smaller contribution from single layer clouds. Most IWC profiles (80 \%) can be represented by a rectangular or isosceles trapezoid shape. However, with increasing IWP, the number of lower triangle profiles (IWC rises towards cloud base) increases, reaching up to 40 \% for IWP values greater than 300 g m-2. The number of upper triangle profiles (IWC rises towards cloud top) is in general small and decreases with IWP, with the maximum occurrence of 15 \% in cases of IWP less than 10 g m-2. We propose a statistical classification of the IWC shapes using IWP as a single parameter. We have estimated the radiative effects of clouds with the same IWP and with different IWC profile shapes for five typical atmospheric scenarios and over a broad range of IWP, cloud height, cloud vertical extent, and effective ice crystal diameter (De). We explain changes in outgoing LW fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) by the cloud thermal radiance while differences in TOA SW fluxes relate to the De vertical profile within the cloud. Absolute differences in net TOA and surface fluxes associated with these parameterized IWC profiles instead of assuming constant IWC profiles are in general of the order of 1\textendash 2 W m-2: they are negligible for clouds with IWP {$<$} 30 g m-2, but may reach 2 W m-2 for clouds with IWP {$>$} 300 W m-2.},

Probability distribution functions over large scales show that the zeroth, second and fourth moments (equivalent to concentration, ice water content and radar reflectivity) as well as mean particle size have monomodal distributions. Rescaling of the size distributions requiring knowledge of two moments reveals a `universal' distribution that has been fitted with analytically integrable functions. The existence of the `universal' distribution implies that two-moment microphysics schemes are adequate to represent particle size distributions (PSDs). In large-scale models it may be difficult to predict two moments, and so power laws between moments have been found as functions of in-cloud temperature. This means that a model capable of predicting ice water content and temperature can predict ice PSDs to use for calculations requiring knowledge of the size distribution (e.g. precipitation rate, radar reflectivity) or to make direct use of the power laws relating moments of the size distribution.},

  abstract = {Abstract Many microphysical process rates involving snow are proportional to moments of the snow particle size distribution (PSD), and in this study a moment estimation parameterization applicable to both midlatitude and tropical ice clouds is proposed. To this end aircraft snow PSD data were analyzed from tropical anvils [Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission/Kwajelein Experiment (TRMM/KWAJEX), Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers-Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE)] and midlatitude stratiform cloud [First International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project Research Experiment (FIRE), Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM)]. For half of the dataset, moments of the PSDs are computed and a parameterization is generated for estimating other PSD moments when the second moment (proportional to the ice water content when particle mass is proportional to size squared) and temperature are known. Subsequently the parameterization was tested with the other half of the dataset to facilitate an independent comparison. The parameterization for estimating moments can be applied to midlatitude or tropical clouds without requiring prior knowledge of the regime of interest. Rescaling of the tropical and midlatitude size distributions is presented along with fits to allow the user to recreate realistic PSDs given estimates of ice water content and temperature. The effects of using different time averaging were investigated and were found not to be adverse. Finally, the merits of a single-moment snow microphysics versus multimoment representations are discussed, and speculation on the physical differences between the rescaled size distributions from the Tropics and midlatitudes is presented.},

The radiation measurements are complemented by in situ cirrus crystal size distribution measurements and radiative transfer simulations based on the microphysical data. The close collocation of the radiative and microphysical measurements, above, beneath, and inside the cirrus, is accomplished by using a research aircraft (Learjet 35A) in tandem with the towed sensor platform AIRTOSS (AIRcraft TOwed Sensor Shuttle). AIRTOSS can be released from and retracted back to the research aircraft by means of a cable up to a distance of 4 km. Data were collected from two field campaigns over the North Sea and the Baltic Sea in spring and late summer 2013. One measurement flight over the North Sea proved to be exemplary, and as such the results are used to illustrate the benefits of collocated sampling. The radiative transfer simulations were applied to quantify the impact of cloud particle properties such as crystal shape, effective radius reff, and optical thickness {$\tau$} on cirrus spectral optical layer properties. Furthermore, the radiative effects of low-level, liquid water (warm) clouds as frequently observed beneath the cirrus are evaluated. They may cause changes in the radiative forcing of the cirrus by a factor of 2. When low-level clouds below the cirrus are not taken into account, the radiative cooling effect (caused by reflection of solar radiation) due to the cirrus in the solar (shortwave) spectral range is significantly overestimated.},

However, numerical simulations suggest that a mean updraft speed of 0.75 m s-1 would need to be sustained for over one hour. Graupel can efficiently remove moisture and aerosols from the boundary layer. The causes and impacts of Arctic riming enhancement remain to be determined.},

  abstract = {A representation of atmospheric chemistry has been included in the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The new chemistry modules complement the aerosol modules of the IFS for atmospheric composition, which is named C-IFS. C-IFS for chemistry supersedes a coupled system in which chemical transport model (CTM) Model for OZone and Related chemical Tracers 3 was two-way coupled to the IFS (IFS-MOZART). This paper contains a description of the new on-line implementation, an evaluation with observations and a comparison of the performance of C-IFS with MOZART and with a re-analysis of atmospheric composition produced by IFS-MOZART within the Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) project. The chemical mechanism of C-IFS is an extended version of the Carbon Bond 2005 (CB05) chemical mechanism as implemented in CTM Transport Model 5 (TM5). CB05 describes tropospheric chemistry with 54 species and 126 reactions. Wet deposition and lightning nitrogen monoxide (NO) emissions are modelled in C-IFS using the detailed input of the IFS physics package. A 1 year simulation by C-IFS, MOZART and the MACC re-analysis is evaluated against ozonesondes, carbon monoxide (CO) aircraft profiles, European surface observations of ozone (O3), CO, sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) as well as satellite retrievals of CO, tropospheric NO2 and formaldehyde. Anthropogenic emissions from the MACC/CityZen (MACCity) inventory and biomass burning emissions from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) data set were used in the simulations by both C-IFS and MOZART. C-IFS (CB05) showed an improved performance with respect to MOZART for CO, upper tropospheric O3, and wintertime SO2, and was of a similar accuracy for other evaluated species. C-IFS (CB05) is about 10 times more computationally efficient than IFS-MOZART.},

  abstract = {A new global reanalysis data set of atmospheric composition (AC) for the period 2003\textendash 2015 has been produced by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Satellite observations of total column (TC) carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD), as well as several TC and profile observations of ozone, have been assimilated with the Integrated Forecasting System for Composition (C-IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting. Compared to the previous Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) reanalysis (MACCRA), the new CAMS interim reanalysis (CAMSiRA) is of a coarser horizontal resolution of about 110 km, compared to 80 km, but covers a longer period with the intent to be continued to present day. This paper compares CAMSiRA with MACCRA and a control run experiment (CR) without assimilation of AC retrievals. CAMSiRA has smaller biases than the CR with respect to independent observations of CO, AOD and stratospheric ozone. However, ozone at the surface could not be improved by the assimilation because of the strong impact of surface processes such as dry deposition and titration with nitrogen monoxide (NO), which were both unchanged by the assimilation. The assimilation of AOD led to a global reduction of sea salt and desert dust as well as an exaggerated increase in sulfate. Compared to MACCRA, CAMSiRA had smaller biases for AOD, surface CO and TC ozone as well as for upper stratospheric and tropospheric ozone. Finally, the temporal consistency of CAMSiRA was better than the one of MACCRA. This was achieved by using a revised emission data set as well as by applying careful selection and bias correction to the assimilated retrievals. CAMSiRA is therefore better suited than MACCRA for the study of interannual variability, as demonstrated for trends in surface CO.},

When considered on a gridpoint-by-gridpoint basis, MCAOs are more severe and more frequent in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) than the Southern Hemisphere (SH) in winter. However, when MCAOs are viewed as individual events regardless of horizontal extent, they occur more frequently in the SH. This is fundamentally because NH MCAOs are larger and stronger than those in the SH. MCAOs occur throughout the year, but in warm seasons and in the SH they are smaller and weaker than in cold seasons and in the NH. In both hemispheres, strong MCAOs occupy the cold air sector of midlatitude cyclones, which generally appear to be in their growth phase. Weak MCAOs in the SH occur under generally zonal flow with a slight northward component associated with weak zonal pressure gradients, while weak NH MCAOs occur under such a wide range of conditions that no characteristic synoptic pattern emerges from compositing. Strong boundary layer deepening, warming, and moistening occur as a result of the surface heat fluxes within MCAOs.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present long-term observations of the multiwavelength Raman lidar PollyXT conducted in the framework of the DACAPO-PESO campaign. Regardless of the relatively clean atmosphere in the southern mid-latitude oceans region, we regularly observed events of long-range transported smoke, originating either from regional sources in South America or from Australia. Two case studies will be discussed, both identified as smoke events that occurred on 5 February 2019 and 11 March 2019. For the first case considered, the lofted smoke layer was located at an altitude between 1.0 and 4.2 km, and apart from the predominance of smoke particles, particle linear depolarization values indicated the presence of dust particles. Mean lidar ratio values at 355 and 532 nm were 49 \&plusmn; 12 and 24 \&plusmn; 18 sr respectively, while the mean particle linear depolarization was 7.6 \&plusmn; 3.6\% at 532 nm. The advection of smoke and dust particles above Punta Arenas affected significantly the available cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and ice nucleating particles (INP) in the lower troposphere, and effectively triggered the ice crystal formation processes. Regarding the second case, the thin smoke layers were observed at altitudes 5.5\&ndash;7.0, 9.0 and 11.0 km. The particle linear depolarization ratio at 532 nm increased rapidly with height, starting from 2\% for the lowest two layers and increasing up to 9.5\% for the highest layer, indicating the possible presence of non-spherical coated soot aggregates. INP activation was effectively facilitated. The long-term analysis of the one year of observations showed that tropospheric smoke advection over Punta Arenas occurred 16 times (lasting from 1 to 17 h), regularly distributed over the period and with high potential to influence cloud formation in the otherwise pristine environment of the region.},

  abstract = {Halo displays in the sky contain valuable information about ice crystal shape and orientation: e.g., the 22\textdegree{} halo is produced by randomly oriented hexagonal prisms while parhelia (sundogs) indicate oriented plates. HaloCam, a novel sun-tracking camera system for the automated observation of halo displays is presented. An initial visual evaluation of the frequency of halo displays for the ACCEPT (Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques) field campaign from October to mid-November 2014 showed that sundogs were observed more often than 22\textdegree{} halos. Thus, the majority of halo displays was produced by oriented ice crystals. During the campaign about 27 \% of the cirrus clouds produced 22\textdegree{} halos, sundogs or upper tangent arcs. To evaluate the HaloCam observations collected from regular measurements in Munich between January 2014 and June 2016, an automated detection algorithm for 22\textdegree{} halos was developed, which can be extended to other halo types as well. This algorithm detected 22\textdegree{} halos about 2 \% of the time for this dataset. The frequency of cirrus clouds during this time period was estimated by co-located ceilometer measurements using temperature thresholds of the cloud base. About 25 \% of the detected cirrus clouds occurred together with a 22\textdegree{} halo, which implies that these clouds contained a certain fraction of smooth, hexagonal ice crystals. HaloCam observations complemented by radiative transfer simulations and measurements of aerosol and cirrus cloud optical thickness (AOT and COT) provide a possibility to retrieve more detailed information about ice crystal roughness. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a completely automated method to collect and evaluate a long-term database of halo observations and shows the potential to characterize ice crystal properties.},

This characterization procedure can be generalized to other RGB camera systems with similar field of view. HaloCamRAW is part of the automated halo observation system HaloCam and designed for the quantitative analysis of halo displays. The geometric calibration was performed using a chessboard pattern to estimate camera matrix and distortion coefficients. For the radiometric characterization of HaloCamRAW, the dark signal and vignetting effect were determined to correct the measured signal. Furthermore, the spectral response of the RGB sensor and the linearity of its radiometric response were characterized. The absolute radiometric response was estimated by cross calibrating HaloCamRAW against the completely characterized spectrometer of the Munich Aerosol Cloud Scanner (specMACS). For a typical measurement signal the relative (absolute) radiometric uncertainty amounts to 2.8 \% (5.0 \%), 2.4 \% (5.8 \%), and 3.3 \% (11.8 \%) for the red, green, and blue channel, respectively. The absolute radiometric uncertainty estimate is larger mainly due to the inhomogeneity of the scene used for cross calibration and the absolute radiometric uncertainty of specMACS. Geometric and radiometric characterization of HaloCamRAW were applied to a scene with a 22{$\circ$} halo observed on 21 April 2016. The observed radiance distribution and 22{$\circ$} halo ratio compared well with radiative transfer simulations assuming a range of ice crystal habits and surface roughness values. This application demonstrates the potential of developing a retrieval method for ice crystal properties, such as ice crystal size, shape, and surface roughness using calibrated HaloCamRAW observations together with radiative transfer simulations.},

The calibration method provides results which are in a good agreement with conventional methods based on radiosondes. The calibration factor derived from the proposed IWV method is very stable with a relative uncertainty of 5 \%. This stability allows for the calibration of the lidar even in the presence of clouds using the calibration factor determined during the most recent clear sky interval. Based on the application of this approach, it is possible to retrieve water vapour profiles during all non-precipitating conditions.

  abstract = {Observations of the microphysical and radiative properties of two cirrus clouds are reported. The measurements were taken from the C-130 aircraft of the UK Meteorological Research Flight as part of the field campaign of the International Cirrus Experiment, ICE'89. Cirrus microphysical properties are analysed in terms of ice water content and a suitably defined ice crystal `effective radius'. Estimates of the ice water content are derived from both a standard Particle Measuring Systems 2D-C cloud probe and a Lyman-{$\alpha$} total water content (TWC) hygrometer. With both flights large discrepancies are seen to occur between the two instruments near the cloud base and top, with the ice water contents derived from the TWC probe being consistently greater than those from the 2D-C probe. Evidence is presented which suggests that the differences near the cloud base are due to a significant number of large ({$>$}800 {$\mu$}m) crystals, which the 2D-C probe is unable to sample. Near the cloud top the differences are assumed to be due to small ({$<$}100{$\mu$}m) crystals, which the 2D-C probe is again unable to sample correctly. Thus more weight has been given to the TWC probe measurements of ice water content, with the measurements of ice crystal effective radius being adjusted accordingly. Model clouds, constructed from the microphysical measurements, are used as input to a number of radiation parametrizations, both in the long-wave and short-wave regions of the spectrum. In the long wave, model agreement with both narrow-band and broad-band measurements is reasonably good, although discrepancies exist near the cloud tops. Some evidence is presented which suggests that the measured effective radii from one of the flights are too large to explain the radiative characteristics of the cloud. The effect of long-wave scattering is shown to be small. The inferred long-wave broad-band mass-absorption coefficient varies between 0.002 m2g-1 and 0.087 m2g-1, and it shows a marked inverse dependence on the ice crystal effective radius, as anticipated by simple theoretical calculations. In the short wave, agreement between the measured irradiances and those computed using several parametrizations is again reasonably good, although limited by the natural variability of the clouds. The net radiation budgets of both cloud layers are analysed, and the possibility of the existence of a relationship between ice water content and effective radius is considered.},

Currently, the AIRTOSS isinstrumented with a Cloud Imaging Probe (CIP) for measuring cloud microphysical properties and an Inertial NavigationSystem (INS) for measurements of flight attitudes. The cabledragging AIRTOSS can be as long as four kilometres. Thus, truly collocated measurements in two altitudes above, in, andbelow clouds can be obtained. Results from first test flightswith Learjet and AIRTOSS are reported here. The flights were performed from Hohn Airport, Germany. Specific ma-noeuvres were flown to test the aerodynamic behaviour of the drag-body and to investigate the suitability of AIRTOSS for high-precision irradiance measurements which require a stable flight attitude of AIRTOSS. The flight attitude data show that AIRTOSS is sensitive to several flight manoeuvres such as turns, altitude and airspeed changes, and also to changes of towing cable length. The effects of these manoeuvres on the attitude angles of AIRTOSS have been quantified. Maximum roll angle deviations were observed during turns. Even small changes in heading can lead to high roll angles (one degree change in heading causes a change in roll angle of about eight degrees). The pitch angle varies during climb or dive periods, extending or retracting of towing cable, acceleration or deceleration, and even when flying at too low or too high true airspeed depending on altitude. Values of pitch angle between -5 degree (dive) and 8 degree (climb and retracting towing cable) have been observed. While change in attitude is not problematic for cloud particle property measurements it is for radiation measurements. Here, the deviation from the horizontal should be no more than 3 degree to avoid large errors. When keeping the above mentioned flight parameters constant, sufficiently stable flight conditions can be maintained to perform high-quality irradiance measurements with AIRTOSS in future experiments. During this test campaign also observations of cloud microphysical data as for example droplet number concentrations and size distributions with the AIRTOSS in stratocumulus clouds were performed to prove the compliance with scientific needs. Simultaneous spectral cloud radiation measurements have been made. The measurements of internal operational data of AIRTOSS as wel las the first atmospheric data demonstrate the suitability of this tandem platform for detailed cloud microphysics and radiation interaction studies.},

  abstract = {An accurate parameterization of the solar radiative properties of cirrus clouds is developed based on improved light scattering calculations. Here 28 ice crystal size distributions from in situ aircraft observations in both tropical and midlatitude regions are employed. In the single scattering calculations, the most recent measurements of the imaginary refractive indices of ice are used, thereby eliminating a large existing uncertainty. The single scattering properties of hexagonal ice crystals are calculated by using an improved geometric ray-tracing program that can produce accurate results for size parameters larger than 15. A generalized effective size, Dge is defined to account for the ice crystal size distribution in the radiative calculations. Based on physical principles, the single scattering properties have been parameterized in terms of ice water content (IWC) and Dge. This allows the cirrus cloud single scattering properties to respond independently to changes in IWC or Dge. The generalized effective size can be related to the total cross-sectional area of ice particles per unit volume, a quantity directly measured by the 2D optical probe in in situ microphysical observations of cirrus clouds. The present parameterization of the extinction coefficient and the single scattering albedo in terms of IWC and Dge can be properly applied to cirrus clouds that contain various nonspherical particles, such as plates, columns, bullet rosettes, and aggregates, etc. The present parameterization of the single scattering properties of cirrus clouds is evaluated by examining the bulk radiative properties for a wide range of atmospheric conditions. Compared with reference results, the typical relative errors due to the parameterization are {$\sim$}1.2\%, {$\sim$}0.3\%, and {$\sim$}2.9\% in reflectance, transmittance, and absorptance, respectively. The accuracy of this parameterization guarantees its reliability in applications to climate models. Cloud absorption plays an important role in cloud-radiation interactions and therefore in climate systems. Because of the large variation in the co-albedo of ice near the wavelength of 1.41 {$\mu$}m sum, one of the spectral divisions is chosen at 1.41 {$\mu$}m to predict cloud absorption properly. Furthermore, the averaging technique for single scattering albedo in spectral intervals associated with absorption bands is important for the parameterization of radiative properties of ice clouds.},

  abstract = {Abstract The aspect ratio (AR) of a nonspherical ice particle is identified as the key microphysical parameter to determine its asymmetry factor for solar radiation. The mean effective AR is defined for cirrus clouds containing various nonspherical ice particles. A new parameterization of the asymmetry factor of cirrus clouds in terms of AR and mean effective size, Dge, is developed for solar radiation. It is based on geometric ray-tracing calculations for hexagonal ice crystals with a simple representation of particle surface roughness. The present parameterization well reproduces the asymmetry factors of complicated ice particles such as bullet rosettes, aggregates with rough surfaces, and fractal crystals and agrees well with observations. It thus can be properly applied to cirrus clouds containing various nonspherical ice particles. The asymmetry factor from this parameterization in the visible spectrum ranges from about 0.73 to more than 0.85. Radiative transfer calculations show that for a cirrus cloud with an optical depth of 4 and a solar zenith angle of 60\textdegree, changes in AR from 1.0 to 0.5 or from 1.0 to 0.1 result in differences in reflected solar fluxes of about -30 or -70 W m-2, respectively. For the same cloudy conditions, the effect of ice particle surface roughness on the reflected solar flux is found to be about 20 W m-2.},

This analysis establishes the relationship between large-scale atmospheric circulation and principal determinants of GrIS mass balance: moisture, cloud properties, radiative forcing, and temperature. Using self-organizing maps (SOMs), observations from the Integrated Characterization of Energy, Clouds, Atmospheric State, and Precipitation at Summit (ICECAPS) project are categorized by daily sea level pressure (SLP) gradient. The results describe in detail how southerly, northerly, and zonal circulation regimes impact observations at Summit Station, Greenland. This southerly regime is linked to large anomalous increases in low-level liquid cloud formation, cloud radiative forcing (CRF), and surface warming at Summit Station. An individual southerly pattern relates to the largest positive anomalies, with the most extreme 25\% of cases leading to CRF anomalies above 21 W m-2 and temperature anomalies beyond 8.5\textdegree C. Finally, the July 2012 extreme melt event is analyzed, showing that the prolonged ice sheet warming was related to persistence of these southerly circulation patterns, causing an unusually extended period of anomalous CRF and temperature. These results demonstrate a novel methodology, connecting daily atmospheric circulation to a relatively brief record of observations.},

Medical image analysis aims to provide a more efficient diagnostic and treatment process for the radiologists and clinicians. However, with the development of science and technology, data interpretation manually in the conventional CAD systems has gradually become a challenging task. Deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are successfully used as tools to solve this problem. This includes applications such as breast cancer diagnosis, lung nodule detection and prostate cancer localization. In this overview, the current state-of-the-art medical image analysis techniques in CAD research are presented, which focus on the convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods. The commonly used medical image databases in literature are also listed. It is anticipated that this paper can provide researchers in radiomics, precision medicine, and imaging grouping with a systematic picture of the CNN-based methods used in CAD research.},

The measurements were obtained with a Cloud-Integrating Nephelometer (CIN) in arctic clouds in May and June 1998. The CIN was evaluated by comparing its measurements of the single-scattering properties of water clouds with values from Mie theory using measurements of the droplet size spectra. These results are used to interpret CIN measurements of the single-scattering properties of ice and mixed-phase clouds. For cirrus clouds composed solely of ice crystals the derived value of g was 0.74{$\pm$}0.03 (or 0.76{$\pm$}0.03 if ice crystal faces are assumed to be perfectly smooth and parallel); this value is significantly lower than that calculated assuming the ice crystals to be hexagonal prisms or bullet rosettes. The CIN measurements of {$\beta$}ext for cirrus clouds were several times greater than values derived from measurements of the cross-sectional areas and concentrations of the ice crystals. Several possible explanations for the differences between calculated and measured optical properties of the ice clouds are discussed. The measured values of g for mixed-phase clouds depended on the relative concentrations of water and ice. These results are used to show that the albedo of clouds is particularly sensitive to the onset of ice formation. Weak convective clouds and clouds saturated with respect to liquid water generally had higher values of g than those for nonconvective clouds or clouds saturated with respect to ice but subsaturated with respect to liquid water.},

Observations indicate that there can be a much broader range of orientation angles, with a larger median value, than has been indicated by previous observational and theoretical studies. The data show that aspect ratio depends on riming extent but that orientation is only weakly dependent on the degree of riming and on particle size. Instead, more vertical orientations for frozen particles become increasingly common with higher turbulence. The results suggest that distributions of size, fall speed, orientation, and aspect ratio may each need to be considered in order to optimize the accuracy of precipitation retrievals using microwave sensors.},

Our cirrus scheme takes into account the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing, preexisting ice crystals, and the full spectrum of updraft velocities. While we find that the cirrus cloud radiative effect evaluated from our model is positive and large enough (5.7 W/m2) to confirm their geoengineering potential, none of the seeding strategies achieves a significant cooling due to complex microphysical mechanisms limiting their climatic responses. After globally uniform seeding is applied, we observe an increase in cirrus cloud cover, a decrease in ice crystal number concentration, and a decrease in ice crystal radius. An analysis of their respective radiative contributions points to the ice crystal radius decrease as the main factor limiting seeding effectiveness.},

  abstract = {Background Although studies have provided estimates of premature deaths attributable to either heat or cold in selected countries, none has so far offered a systematic assessment across the whole temperature range in populations exposed to different climates. We aimed to quantify the total mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperature, and the relative contributions from heat and cold and from moderate and extreme temperatures. Methods We collected data for 384 locations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, UK, and USA. We fitted a standard time-series Poisson model for each location, controlling for trends and day of the week. We estimated temperature\textendash mortality associations with a distributed lag non-linear model with 21 days of lag, and then pooled them in a multivariate metaregression that included country indicators and temperature average and range. We calculated attributable deaths for heat and cold, defined as temperatures above and below the optimum temperature, which corresponded to the point of minimum mortality, and for moderate and extreme temperatures, defined using cutoffs at the 2{$\cdot$}5th and 97{$\cdot$}5th temperature percentiles. Findings We analysed 74\hphantom{,}225\hphantom{,}200 deaths in various periods between 1985 and 2012. In total, 7{$\cdot$}71\% (95\% empirical CI 7{$\cdot$}43\textendash 7{$\cdot$}91) of mortality was attributable to non-optimum temperature in the selected countries within the study period, with substantial differences between countries, ranging from 3{$\cdot$}37\% (3{$\cdot$}06 to 3{$\cdot$}63) in Thailand to 11{$\cdot$}00\% (9{$\cdot$}29 to 12{$\cdot$}47) in China. The temperature percentile of minimum mortality varied from roughly the 60th percentile in tropical areas to about the 80\textendash 90th percentile in temperate regions. More temperature-attributable deaths were caused by cold (7{$\cdot$}29\%, 7{$\cdot$}02\textendash 7{$\cdot$}49) than by heat (0{$\cdot$}42\%, 0{$\cdot$}39\textendash 0{$\cdot$}44). Extreme cold and hot temperatures were responsible for 0{$\cdot$}86\% (0{$\cdot$}84\textendash 0{$\cdot$}87) of total mortality. Interpretation Most of the temperature-related mortality burden was attributable to the contribution of cold. The effect of days of extreme temperature was substantially less than that attributable to milder but non-optimum weather. This evidence has important implications for the planning of public-health interventions to minimise the health consequences of adverse temperatures, and for predictions of future effect in climate-change scenarios.

The sequence is documented using collocated scanning and profiling radar, including longer-wavelength dual polarization measurements and shorter-wavelength Doppler spectra. Riming regions are supported using aircraft measurements recording elevated liquid water concentrations, spherical particle shapes, and saturation with respect to water. Profiling cloud radar observations indicate riming regions during the event as having increasing particle fall speeds, rapid time-height changes, and bimodalities in Doppler spectra. These particular riming signatures are coupled to scanning dual polarization radar observations of higher differential reflectivity (ZDR) aloft. Moreover, reduced melting layer enhancements and delayed radar bright-band signatures in the column are also observed during riming periods, most notably with the profiling radar observations. The bimodal cloud radar Doppler spectra captured near riming zones indicate two time-height spectral ice peaks, one rimed particle peak, and one peak associated with pristine ice needle generation and/or growth between -4\textdegree C and -7\textdegree C also sampled by aircraft probes. We observe this pristine needle population near the rimed particle region which gives a partial explanation for the enhanced ZDR. The riming signatures aloft and radar measurements within the melting level are weakly lag correlated (r 0.6) with smaller median drop sizes at the surface, as compared with later times when aggregation of larger particle sizes was believed dominant.},

On average, ice supersaturation occurs in about 40 \% to 60 \% of the profiles with frequency of occurrence increasing with geographic latitude. The frequencies of occurrence show (so far) no long-term trends. The seasonal cycles are not very clear but seem to reverse between more southern to more northern locations. Most profiles with ice-supersaturation have more than one supersaturated layer; this stacking increases as well to the north. Due to the 1-Hz resolution of the data we find ice-supersaturated layers a few metres thick, but very thick layers extending over almost 5 km are found as well. Median thickness values are smaller than in previous studies, between 100 m and 200 m. The far northern locations display a strong seasonal cycle of the mean layer thickness with maxima in the polar night, probably caused by radiation cooling. Ice supersaturation occurs most frequently directly beneath the tropopause in an upper-tropospheric layer whose depth varies strongly seasonally, being thin in summer and much thicker in winter. Due to the very low temperatures in the Arctic ice supersaturation can occur at the ground. Temperatures in arctic supersaturated layers typically range from -40 to -60 \textdegree C, but can occasionally be lower than -70 \textdegree C. Water vapour volume mixing ratios range from a few to about 500 ppmv. The relative humidity with respect to ice can exceed 150\textendash 160 \%.

  abstract = {Accurate static-pressure measurements are a prerequisite for safe navigation and precise air-data measurements on aircraft. Pressure is also fundamental for wind and air temperature analysis in meteorology. Static-pressure measurement by aircraft is disturbed by aerodynamics and needs to be corrected using calibration. In this paper, a comparison has been made between static pressure measured by means of a trailing cone in the atmosphere behind two different jet aircraft at flight levels up to 450 and data from numerical weather predictions. The height is derived from differential Global Navigation Satellite System measurements. The Global Navigation Satellite System height is compared to numerical-weather-prediction geopotential height. The numerical-weather-prediction data were provided by the Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. When computing the geopotential with latitude-/height-dependent gravity, the pressure/height differences are -0.01{$\pm$}0.15 hPa and 0.6{$\pm$}0.2 m. This pressure accuracy implies numerical-weather-prediction temperature errors {$<$}0.1 K on average below 10 km altitude. The trailing-cone measurements provide a first quantification of the case-specific accuracy of numerical-weather-prediction pressure\textendash geopotential relationships. The method of comparing operational pressure/Global Navigation Satellite System measurements on aircraft with numerical-weather-prediction analysis or predictions can be used to test the height-keeping performance of aircraft after or during operation.},

  abstract = {A new comprehensive cloud\textendash{} precipitation\textendash{} meteorological observatory has been established at Princess Elisabeth base, located in the escarpment zone of Dronning Maud Land (DML), East Antarctica. The observatory consists of a set of ground-based remote-sensing instruments (ceilometer, infrared pyrometer and vertically profiling precipitation radar) combined with automatic weather station measurements of near-surface meteorology, radiative fluxes, and snow height. In this paper, the observatory is presented and the potential for studying the evolution of clouds and precipitating systems is illustrated by case studies. It is shown that the synergetic use of the set of instruments allows for distinguishing ice, liquid-containing clouds and precipitating clouds, including some information on their vertical extent. In addition, wind-driven blowing snow events can be distinguished from deeper precipitating systems. Cloud properties largely affect the surface radiative fluxes, with liquid-containing clouds dominating the radiative impact. A statistical analysis of all measurements (in total 14 months mainly during summer\textendash{} beginning of winter) indicates that these liquid-containing clouds occur during as much as 20\% of the cloudy periods. The cloud occurrence shows a strong bimodal distribution with clear-sky conditions 51\% of the time and complete overcast conditions 35\% of the time. Snowfall occurred during 17\% of the cloudy periods with a predominance of light precipitation and only rare events with snowfall {$>$}1 mm h-1 water equivalent (w.e.). Three of such intense snowfall events occurred during 2011 contributing to anomalously large annual surface mass balance (SMB). Large accumulation events ({$>$}10 mm w.e. day-1) during the radar-measurement period of 26 months were always associated with snowfall, but at the same time other snowfall events did not always lead to accumulation. The multiyear deployment of a precipitation radar in Antarctica allows for assessing the contribution of the snowfall to the local SMB and comparing it to the other SMB components. During 2012, snowfall rate was 110 \textbackslash pm 20 mm w.e. yr-1, from which surface and drifting snow sublimation removed together 23\%. Given the measured yearly SMB of 52 \textbackslash pm 3 mm w.e., the residual term of 33 \textbackslash pm 21 mm w.e. yr-1 was attributed to the wind-driven snow erosion. In general, this promising set of robust instrumentation allows for improved insight into cloud and precipitation processes in Antarctica and can be easily deployed at other Antarctic stations.},

The main purpose of the radar is to provide long-term datasets of cloud parameters for model evaluation, satellite validation, and climatological studies. Therefore, the system operates with largely unchanged parameter settings and a vertically pointing antenna. The accuracy of the internal calibration (budget calibration) has been appraised to be 1.3 dB. Cloud parameters are derived by two different approaches: macrophysical parameters have been deduced for the complete period of operation through combination with ceilometer measurements; a more enhanced target classification and the calculation of liquid and ice water contents are realized by algorithms developed in the framework of the European CloudNet project.},

  abstract = {Representation of cloud microphysics is a key aspect of simulating clouds. From the early days of cloud modeling, numerical models have relied on an Eulerian approach for all cloud and thermodynamic and microphysics variables. Over time the sophistication of microphysics schemes has steadily increased, from simple representations of bulk masses of cloud and rain in each grid cell, to including different ice particle types and bulk hydrometeor concentrations, to complex schemes referred to as bin or spectral schemes that explicitly evolve the hydrometeor size distributions within each model grid cell. As computational resources grow, there is a clear trend toward wider use of bin schemes, including their use as benchmarks to develop and test simplified bulk schemes. We argue that continuing on this path brings fundamental challenges difficult to overcome. The Lagrangian particle-based probabilistic approach is a practical alternative in which the myriad of cloud and precipitation particles present in a natural cloud is represented by a judiciously selected ensemble of point particles called super-droplets or superparticles. Advantages of the Lagrangian particle-based approach when compared to the Eulerian bin methodology are explained and prospects of applying the method to more comprehensive cloud simulations, for instance targeting deep convection or frontal cloud systems, are discussed.},

  abstract = {From 25 May to 21 July 2017, the research vessel Polarstern performed the cruise PS106 to the high Arctic in the region north and northeast of Svalbard. The mobile remote-sensing platform OCEANET was deployed aboard Polarstern. Within a single container, OCEANET houses state-of-the-art remote-sensing equipment, including a multiwavelength Raman polarization lidar PollyXT and a 14- channel microwave radiometer HATPRO (Humidity And Temperature PROfiler). For the cruise PS106, the measurements were supplemented by a motion-stabilized 35 GHz cloud radar Mira-35. This paper describes the treatment of technical challenges which were immanent during the deployment of OCEANET in the high Arctic. This includes the description of the motion stabilization of the cloud radar Mira-35 to ensure vertical-pointing observations aboard the moving Polarstern as well as the applied correction of the vessels heave rate to provide valid Doppler velocities. The correction ensured a leveling accuracy of {$\pm$}0.5\textdegree{} during transits through the ice and an ice floe camp. The applied heave correction reduced the signal induced by the vertical movement of the cloud radar in the PSD of the Doppler velocity by a factor of 15. Low-level clouds, in addition, frequently prevented a continuous analysis of cloud conditions from synergies of lidar and radar within Cloudnet, because the technically determined lowest detection height of Mira-35 was 165 m above sea level. To overcome this obstacle, an approach for identification of the cloud presence solely based on data from the near-field receiver of PollyXT at heights from 50 m and 165 m above sea level is presented. We found low-level stratus clouds, which were below the lowest detection range of most automatic ground-based remote-sensing instruments during 25 \% of the observation time. We present case studies of aerosol and cloud studies to introduce the capabilities of the data set. In addition, new approaches for ice crystal effective radius and eddy dissipation rates from cloud radar measurements and the retrieval of aerosol optical and microphysical properties from the observations of PollyXT are introduced.},

  abstract = {The cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) is of central interest to improve the understanding of cloud physics and for quantifying the effective radiative forcing by aerosol-cloud interactions. Current standard satellite retrievals do not operationally provide Nd, but it can be inferred from retrievals of cloud optical depth (c) cloud droplet effective radius (re) and cloud top temperature. This review summarizes issues with this approach and quantifies uncertainties. A total relative uncertainty of 78\% is inferred for pixel-level retrievals for relatively homogeneous, optically thick and unobscured stratiform clouds with favorable viewing geometry. The uncertainty is even greater if these conditions are not met. For averages over 1{$\circ$} \texttimes 1{$\circ$} regions the uncertainty is reduced to 54\% assuming random errors for instrument uncertainties. In contrast, the few evaluation studies against reference in situ observations suggest much better accuracy with little variability in the bias. More such studies are required for a better error characterization. Nd uncertainty is dominated by errors in re, and therefore, improvements in re retrievals would greatly improve the quality of the Nd retrievals. Recommendations are made for how this might be achieved. Some existing Nd data sets are compared and discussed, and best practices for the use of Nd data from current passive instruments (e.g., filtering criteria) are recommended. Emerging alternative Nd estimates are also considered. First, new ideas to use additional information from existing and upcoming spaceborne instruments are discussed, and second, approaches using high-quality ground-based observations are examined.\dbend},

Due to sparse in situ measurements of ice cloud properties, the controls on the Ni have remained difficult to determine. As more advanced treatments of ice clouds are included in global models, it is becoming increasingly necessary to develop strong observational constraints on the processes involved. This work uses the DARDAR-Nice Ni retrieval described in Part 1 to investigate the controls on the Ni at a global scale. The retrieved clouds are separated by type. The effects of temperature, proxies for in-cloud updraft and aerosol concentrations are investigated. Variations in the cloud top Ni (Ni(top)) consistent with both homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation are observed along with differing relationships between aerosol and Ni(top) depending on the prevailing meteorological situation and aerosol type. Away from the cloud top, the Ni displays a different sensitivity to these controlling factors, providing a possible explanation for the low Ni sensitivity to temperature and ice nucleating particles (INP) observed in previous in situ studies. This satellite dataset provides a new way of investigating the response of cloud properties to meteorological and aerosol controls. The results presented in this work increase our confidence in the retrieved Ni and will form the basis for further study into the processes influencing ice and mixed phase clouds.},

The capabilities of such models are discussed based on comparisons with observations and model-intercomparison studies. CRMs are used in a variety of ways, from the exploration of cloud phenomenology and process-understanding studies to the development of algorithms for satellite products, as well as to address climate issues and to develop convective and cloud parametrizations for large-scale weather and climate models. A few results illustrating this wide utilization are presented. The continuous increase of computer power induces rapid changes in modelling perspectives and therefore, influences the developments and applications of CRMs. This is discussed together with emerging scientific questions which will further benefit from CRM simulations.},

Daily time-series of temperature and precipitation were used from six RCMs for a reference period 1976\textendash 2000 and for 2026\textendash 2050 (`future`) for representative locations, applying a performance selection among neighboring model grid-boxes. The annual average temperatures of the model ensemble have a {$\pm$}1.5\textdegree C bias from the observations (negative for maximum and positive for minimum temperature), and the models underestimate annual precipitation totals by 4\textendash 17\%. The climatological annual cycles for the observations fall within the 1{$\sigma$} range of the 6-model average, highlighting the strength of using multi-model output. We obtain reasonable agreement between models and observations for the temperature-related indices of extremes for the recent past, while the comparison is less good for the precipitation-related extremes. For the future, the RCM ensemble shows significant warming of 1\textdegree C in winter to 2\textdegree C in the summer for both maximum and minimum temperatures. Rainfall is projected to decrease by 2\textendash 8\%, although this is not statistically significant. Our results indicate the shift of the mean climate to a warmer state, with a relatively strong increase in the warm extremes. The precipitation frequency is projected to decrease at the inland Nicosia and at the coastal Limassol, while the mountainous Saittas could experience more frequent 5\textendash 15 mm/day rainfall. In future, very hot days are expected to increase by more than 2 weeks/year and tropical nights by 1 month/year. The annual number of consecutive dry days shows a statistically significant increase (of 9 days) in Limassol. These projected changes of the Cyprus climate may adversely affect ecosystems and the economy of the island and emphasize the need for adaptation strategies.},

  abstract = {Dust aerosols are thought to be the main contributor to atmospheric ice nucleation. While there are case studies supporting this, a climatological sense of the importance of dust to atmospheric ice nucleating particle (INP) concentrations and its seasonal variability over Europe is lacking. Here, we use a mesoscale model to estimate Saharan dust concentrations over Europe in 2008. There are large differences in median dust concentrations between seasons, with the highest concentrations and highest variability in the lower to mid-troposphere. Laboratory-based ice nucleation parameterisations are applied to these simulated dust number concentrations to calculate the potential INP resulting from immersion freezing and deposition nucleation on these dust particles. The potential INP concentrations increase exponentially with height due to decreasing temperatures in the lower and mid-troposphere. When the ice-activated fraction increases sufficiently, INP concentrations follow the dust particle concentrations. The potential INP profiles exhibit similarly large differences between seasons, with the highest concentrations in spring (median potential immersion INP concentrations nearly 105 m-3, median potential deposition INP concentrations at 120\% relative humidity with respect to ice over 105 m-3), about an order of magnitude larger than those in summer. Using these results, a best-fit function is provided to estimate the potential INPs for use in limited-area models, which is representative of the normal background INP concentrations over Europe. A statistical evaluation of the results against field and laboratory measurements indicates that the INP concentrations are in close agreement with observations.},

  abstract = {An aerosol model was used to simulate the generation and transport of aerosols over Germany during the HD(CP)2 Observational Prototype Experiment (HOPE) field campaign of 2013. The aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were evaluated against observations, which shows satisfactory agreement in the magnitude and temporal variability of the main aerosol contributors to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. From the modelled aerosol number concentrations, number concentrations of CCN were calculated as a function of vertical velocity using a comprehensive aerosol activation scheme which takes into account the influence of aerosol chemical and physical properties on CCN formation. There is a large amount of spatial variability in aerosol concentrations; however the resulting CCN concentrations vary significantly less over the domain. Temporal variability is large in both aerosols and CCN. A parameterization of the CCN number concentrations is developed for use in models. The technique involves defining a number of best fit functions to capture the dependence of CCN on vertical velocity at different pressure levels. In this way, aerosol chemical and physical properties as well as thermodynamic conditions are taken into account in the new CCN parameterization. A comparison between the parameterization and the CCN estimates from the model data shows excellent agreement. This parameterization may be used in other regions and time periods with a similar aerosol load; furthermore, the technique demonstrated here may be employed in regions dominated by different aerosol species.},

  abstract = {In 2017, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth?s atmosphere?carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxidereached new record highs. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth?s surface for 2017 was 405.0 \dbend{} 0.1 ppm, 2.2 ppm greater than for 2016 and the highest in the modern atmospheric measurement record and in ice core records dating back as far as 800 000 years. The global growth rate of CO 2 has nearly quadrupled since the early 1960s. With ENSO-neutral conditions present in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean during most of the year and weak La Ni\dbend a conditions notable at the start and end, the global temperature across land and ocean surfaces ranked as the second or third highest, depending on the dataset, since records began in the mid-to-late 1800s. Notably, it was the warmest non-El Ni\dbend o year in the instrumental record. Above Earth?s surface, the annual lower tropospheric temperature was also either second or third highest according to all datasets analyzed. The lower stratospheric temperature was about 0.2\dbend C higher than the record cold temperature of 2016 according to most of the in situ and satellite datasets. Several countries, including Argentina, Uruguay, Spain, and Bulgaria, reported record high annual temperatures. Mexico broke its annual record for the fourth consecutive year. On 27 January, the temperature reached 43.4\dbend C at Puerto Madryn, Argentina?the highest temperature recorded so far south (43\dbend S) anywhere in the world. On 28 May in Turbat, western Pakistan, the high of 53.5\dbend C tied Pakistan?s all-time highest temperature and became the world-record highest temperature for May. In the Arctic, the 2017 land surface temperature was 1.6\dbend C above the 1981?2010 average, the second highest since the record began in 1900, behind only 2016. The five highest annual Arctic temperatures have all occurred since 2007. Exceptionally high temperatures were observed in the permafrost across the Arctic, with record values reported in much of Alaska and northwestern Canada. In August, high sea surface temperature (SST) records were broken for the Chukchi Sea, with some regions as warm as +11\dbend C, or 3\dbend{} to 4\dbend C warmer than the longterm mean (1982?present). According to paleoclimate studies, today?s abnormally warm Arctic air and SSTs have not been observed in the last 2000 years. The increasing temperatures have led to decreasing Arctic sea ice extent and thickness. On 7 March, sea ice extent at the end of the growth season saw its lowest maximum in the 37-year satellite record, covering 8 \% less area than the 1981?2010 average. The Arctic sea ice minimum on 13 September was the eighth lowest on record and covered 25 \% less area than the long-term mean. Preliminary data indicate that glaciers across the world lost mass for the 38th consecutive year on record; the declines are remarkably consistent from region to region. Cumulatively since 1980, this loss is equivalent to slicing 22 meters off the top of the average glacier. Antarctic sea ice extent remained below average for all of 2017, with record lows during the first four months. Over the continent, the austral summer seasonal melt extent and melt index were the second highest since 2005, mostly due to strong positive anomalies of air temperature over most of the West Antarctic coast. In contrast, the East Antarctic Plateau saw record low mean temperatures in March. The year was also distinguished by the second smallest Antarctic ozone hole observed since 1988. Across the global oceans, the overall long-term SST warming trend remained strong. Although SST cooled slightly from 2016 to 2017, the last three years produced the three highest annual values observed; these high anomalies have been associated with widespread coral bleaching. The most recent global coral bleaching lasted three full years, June 2014 to May 2017, and was the longest, most widespread, and almost certainly most destructive such event on record. Global integrals of 0?700m and 0?2000-m ocean heat content reached record highs in 2017, and global mean sea level during the year became the highest annual average in the 25-year satellite altimetry record, rising to 77 mm above the 1993 average. In the tropics, 2017 saw 85 named tropical storms, slightly above the 1981?2010 average of 82. The North Atlantic basin was the only basin that featured an above-normal season, its seventh most active in the 164-year record. Three hurricanes in the basin were especially notable. Harvey produced record rainfall totals in areas of Texas and Louisiana, including a storm total of 1538.7 mm near Beaumont, Texas, which far exceeds the previous known U.S. tropical cyclone record of 1320.8 mm. Irma was the strongest tropical cyclone globally in 2017 and the strongest Atlantic hurricane outside of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean on record with maximum winds of 295 km h ?1 . Maria caused catastrophic destruction across the Caribbean Islands, including devastating wind damage and flooding across Puerto Rico. Elsewhere, the western North Pacific, South Indian, and Australian basins were all particularly quiet. Precipitation over global land areas in 2017 was clearly above the long-term average. Among noteworthy regional precipitation records in 2017, Russia reported its second wettest year on record (after 2013) and Norway experienced its sixth wettest year since records began in 1900. Across India, heavy rain and flood-related incidents during the monsoon season claimed around 800 lives. In August and September, above-normal precipitation triggered the most devastating floods in more than a decade in the Venezuelan states of Bol\dbend var and Delta Amacuro. In Nigeria, heavy rain during August and September caused the Niger and Benue Rivers to overflow, bringing floods that displaced more than 100 000 people. Global fire activity was the lowest since at least 2003; however, high activity occurred in parts of North America, South America, and Europe, with an unusually long season in Spain and Portugal, which had their second and third driest years on record, respectively. Devastating fires impacted British Columbia, destroying 1.2 million hectares of timber, bush, and grassland, due in part to the region?s driest summer on record. In the United States, an extreme western wildfire season burned over 4 million hectares; the total costs of \$18 billion tripled the previous U.S. annual wildfire cost record set in 1991.},

Multiple linear regression is used to relate the radiation budget data to the cloud data. Comparing cloud forcing estimates obtained from the ISCCP-ERBE regression with those derived from the ERBE scene identification shows generally good agreement except over snow, in tropical convective regions, and in regions that are either nearly cloudless or always overcast. It is suggested that a substantial fraction of the disagreement in longwave cloud forcing in tropical convective regions is associated with the fact that the ERBE scene identification does not take into account variations in upper-tropospheric water vapor. On a global average basis, low clouds make the largest contribution to the net energy balance of the earth, because they cover such a large area and because their albedo effect dominates their effect on emitted thermal radiation. High, optically thick clouds can also very effectively reduce the energy balance, however, because their very high albedos overcome their low emission temperatures.},

  abstract = {As integration of solar power into the national electric grid rapidly increases, it becomes imperative to improve forecasting of this highly variable renewable resource. Thus, a team of researchers from the public, private, and academic sectors partnered to develop and assess a new solar power forecasting system, Sun4Cast. The partnership focused on improving decision-making for utilities and independent system operators, ultimately resulting in improved grid stability and cost savings for consumers. The project followed a value chain approach to determine key research and technology needs to reach desired results. Sun4Cast integrates various forecasting technologies across a spectrum of temporal and spatial scales to predict surface solar irradiance. Anchoring the system is WRF-Solar, a version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model optimized for solar irradiance prediction. Forecasts from multiple NWP models are blended via the Dynamic Integrated Forecast (DICast) System, which forms the basis of the system beyond about 6 h. For short-range (0?6 h) forecasts, Sun4Cast leverages several observation-based nowcasting technologies. These technologies are blended via the Nowcasting Expert System Integrator (NESI). The NESI and DICast systems are subsequently blended to produce short- to midterm irradiance forecasts for solar array locations. The irradiance forecasts are translated into power with uncertainties quantified using an analog ensemble approach and are provided to the industry partners for real-time decision-making. The Sun4Cast system ran operationally throughout 2015 and results were assessed. This paper analyzes the collaborative design process, discusses the project results, and provides recommendations for best-practice solar forecasting.},

  abstract = {Die Polargebiete sind in den letzten Jahrzehnten zunehmend in das wissenschaftliche und \"offentliche Interesse ger\"uckt. Es ist z.B. klar geworden, dass Ver\"anderungen in der Arktis sehr viel gr\"o\dbend ere Auswirkungen auf das Klima von Europa haben als man noch vor zehn Jahren angenommen hat. Deutschland kann auf eine lange und erfolgreiche Tradition in der Erforschung der Arktis und Antarktis zur\"uckblicken. Beginnend in der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts haben deutsche Forscher und Forscherinnen wichtige Beitr\"age geleistet, die international gro\dbend e Anerkennung ?nden. Anfang des 21. Jahrhunderts geh\"ort Deutschland mit zu den f\"uhrenden Staaten im Bereich der Polarforschung und kann auf eine 40-j\"ahrige kontinuierliche Pr\"asenz in der Antarktis zur\"uckblicken. Dies wurde m\"oglich durch eine langfristige institutionelle F\"orderung der Bundesministerien f\dbend r Bildung und Forschung (BMBF) und f\"ur Wirtschaft und Energie (BMWi), aber auch durch Projektf\"orderungen von Bundesministerien, der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) und durch EU-Programme. Eine besondere Stellung f\dbend r die universit\textbackslash "\dbend re Antarktisforschung nimmt das DFG-Schwerpunktprogramm ?Antarktisforschung mit vergleichenden Untersuchungen in arktischen Eisgebieten? (SPP1158) ein, das 1981 als Schwerpunktprogramm ?Antarktisforschung? begonnen wurde. Im internationalen Rahmen der Polarforschung ist Deutschland in alle relevanten Organisationen eingebunden. Deutschland ist Mitglied im Wissenschaftlichen Komitee f\dbend r Antarktisforschung (Scienti?c Committee on Antarctic Research, SCAR) und im Internationalen Wissenschaftlichen Komitee f\dbend r Arktisforschung (International Arctic Science Committee, IASC). Dazu hat das Pr\"asidium der DFG im Jahr 1978 einen deutschen Landesausschuss SCAR eingerichtet und diesen im Jahr 1992 mit dem Beitritt der DFG in IASC zum Landesausschuss f\dbend r Forschung in der Antarktis und Arktis erweitert. Das heutige ?Nationalkomitee SCAR/IASC? plant und koordiniert die Aktivit\"aten der deutschen Hochschulforschung auf dem Gebiet der Antarktis- und Arktisforschung zusammen mit dem Alfred-Wegener-Institut sowie den betreffenden staatlichen Einrichtungen. Mitglieder des Nationalkomitees vertreten Deutschland in den internationalen Gremien und nehmen dort z.T. f\"uhrende Positionen ein. Im nationalen Rahmen existieren nur wenige umfassende Forschungsprogramme und Strategien zur Polarforschung. Das letzte of?zielle Polarforschungsprogramm der Bundesregierung wurde 1996 publiziert (Polarforschung, Programm der Bundesregierung, BMBF 1996). Ein Hauptziel dieses Programms war, die Haupterkenntnisse auf dem Gebiet der Polarforschung zusammenzufassen und die forschungspolitischen Ziele der n\"achsten Jahre zu setzen. Eine \"ahnliche Intention wurde (mit Beschr\"ankung auf die Antarktis) mit der in 2002 erschienenen DFG-Denkschrift ?Deutsche Forschung in der Antarktis, Wissenschaftlicher Fortschritt und Perspektiven? verfolgt. Die Fortschritte der Polarforschung in den letzten Dekaden haben das Nationalkomitee f\dbend r Polarforschung SCAR/IASC dazu veranlasst, eine dem Stand der heutigen Forschung entsprechende Polarforschungsagenda zu verfassen. \dbend hnlich wie das BMBF-Polarforschungsprogramm (1996) sollen sowohl ein m\"oglichst allgemein verst\"andlicher \"Uberblick \"uber den Stand der Forschung gegeben als auch die Forschungsfragen der kommenden 10-15 Jahre gestellt werden. Dabei soll speziell herausgestellt werden, wo die St\"arken der deutschen Polarforschung liegen und wo Beitr\dbend ge in besonderem Ma\dbend e geleistet werden k\dbend nnen. Die Hintergrundinformationen zu den wissenschaftlichen Themen sollen Entscheidungstr\"agern in der Politik und wissenschaftlichen Gremien als Referenz dienen und Argumente zur F\dbend rderung der Polarforschung geben k\"onnen. Dies betrifft die Verl\"angerung des Schwerpunktprogramms ?Antarktisforschung?, das z.Z. bis Ende 2018 befristet ist, aber auch das MARE:N-Programm des BMBF und gro\dbend e Investitionen wie der Bau des Forschungseisbrechers ?Polarstern 2?.},

  abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) with the new ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic atmosphere model (ICON) covering Germany are evaluated for four days in spring 2013 using observational data from various sources. Reference simulations with the established Consortium for Small-scale Modelling (COSMO) numerical weather prediction model and further standard LES codes are performed and used as a reference. This comprehensive evaluation approach covers multiple parameters and scales, focusing on boundary-layer variables, clouds and precipitation. The evaluation points to the need to work on parametrizations influencing the surface energy balance, and possibly on ice cloud microphysics. The central purpose for the development and application of ICON in the LES configuration is the use of simulation results to improve the understanding of moist processes, as well as their parametrization in climate models. The evaluation thus aims at building confidence in the model's ability to simulate small- to mesoscale variability in turbulence, clouds and precipitation. The results are encouraging: the high-resolution model matches the observed variability much better at small- to mesoscales than the coarser resolved reference model. In its highest grid resolution, the simulated turbulence profiles are realistic and column water vapour matches the observed temporal variability at short time-scales. Despite being somewhat too large and too frequent, small cumulus clouds are well represented in comparison with satellite data, as is the shape of the cloud size spectrum. Variability of cloud water matches the satellite observations much better in ICON than in the reference model. In this sense, it is concluded that the model is fit for the purpose of using its output for parametrization development, despite the potential to improve further some important aspects of processes that are also parametrized in the high-resolution model.},

The optical properties of these imperfect crystals are sensitive to the aspect ratio (and thus to particle size) as well as to the allowed deviation from the perfect shape.

  abstract = {In recent measurements, liquid water was not detected in cirrus clouds below -40\textdegree C and, since there appear to be few ice-forming nuclei in the upper troposphere, ice nucleation evidently takes place by homogeneous freezing of solution droplets. A numerical model consisting of a system of ordinary differential equations is used to study this process in a rising parcel containing a distribution of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The model traces the evolution of both the particle population (liquid and solid phase) and the thermodynamic variables in the parcel. Droplet growth rates are calculated in 20 size categories assuming ammonium sulfate nuclei; CCN distributions are taken from aircraft data. Homogeneous nucleation rates are derived by classical methods; adjustments for solution effects are made by considering the water vapor pressure over droplet surface. Results for convective cirrus simulations indicate that if homogeneous freezing is not considered, liquid water should be detected below -40\textdegree C; if homogeneous freezing is considered, the rapid growth of ice crystals and concurrent vapor depletion prevent water saturation from being reached. All droplets forming on a given mass CCN freeze almost simultaneously; the homogeneous freezing of most of the entire droplet distribution takes place over a temperature range of less than 1\textdegree C. The likelihood of a droplet being frozen is increased by lower temperatures, larger droplet diameter, or lower solution density. Most of the ice crystals produced originate from droplets containing CCN of mass 10-13 to 10-15 g; the number of ice crystals eventually produced is a function of the temperature, the vertical air velocity, and the CCN distribution.},

Part I of the study reports temperature-dependent coefficients for the mass-dimensional relationship, m = aDb, where D is particle maximum dimension. The fall velocity relationship, Vt = ADB, is developed from observations in synoptic and low-latitude, convectively generated, ice cloud layers, sampled over a wide range of temperatures using an assumed range for the exponent b. Values for a, A, and B were found that were consistent with the measured particle size distributions (PSD) and the ice water content (IWC). To refine the estimates of coefficients a and b to fit both lower and higher moments of the PSD and the associated values for A and B, Part II uses the PSD from Part I plus coincident, vertically pointing Doppler radar returns. The observations and derived coefficients are used to evaluate earlier, single-moment, bulk ice microphysical parameterization schemes as well as to develop improved, statistically based, microphysical relationships. They may be used in cloud and climate models, and to retrieve cloud properties from ground-based Doppler radar and spaceborne, conventional radar returns.},

  abstract = {Abstract This two-part study attempts to find appropriate mass dimension and terminal velocity relationships that, when considered together with particle size distributions (PSD), agree with coincident measurements of ice water content (IWC), and with variables related to higher moments such as the mean mass-weighted fall speed. Reliable relationships are required for improving microphysical parameterizations for weather forecast models and developing methods for evaluating them, subjects addressed in detail in Part II of this study. Here, a range of values from 1.5 to 2.3 is assumed for the exponent b in the mass dimension relationship, m = aDb, where D is the maximum particle dimension, to bound its likely value for sizes above about 100 {$\mu$}m. Measured IWC and size spectra are used to find appropriate values for the coefficient a. It is demonstrated that all values of the exponent b, with appropriate a coefficients, can fit the IWC measurements. Coincident information on particle cross-sectional areas with the m(D) relationships is used to develop general fall velocity relationships of the form Vt = ADB. These assessments use five midlatitude, synoptically generated ice layers, and 10 low-latitude, convectively generated ice cloud layers, spanning the temperature range from -60\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree C. The coefficients a and A and exponent B are represented in terms of the exponent b and are shown to be temperature-dependent for the synoptic clouds and relatively independent of it in the convective clouds, a result of particle mixing through the cloud column. Consistency is found with earlier results and with analytic considerations. It is found that the fall velocity is inversely proportional to the air density to approximately the exponent 0.54, close to values assumed in earlier studies.},

In this study, laboratory measurements of the terminal velocity {$\upsilon$}t for a variety of ice particle models settling in viscous fluids, along with wind-tunnel and field measurements of ice particles settling in air, have been analyzed and compared to common methods of computing {$\upsilon$}t from the literature. It is observed that while these methods work well for a number of particle types, they fail for particles with open geometries, specifically those particles for which the area ratio Ar is small (Ar is defined as the area of the particle projected normal to the flow divided by the area of a circumscribing disc). In particular, the fall speeds of stellar and dendritic crystals, needles, open bullet rosettes, and low-density aggregates are all overestimated. These particle types are important in many cloud types: aggregates in particular often dominate snow precipitation at the ground and vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements. Based on the laboratory data, a simple modification to previous computational methods is proposed, based on the area ratio. This new method collapses the available drag data onto an approximately universal curve, and the resulting errors in the computed fall speeds relative to the tank data are less than 25\% in all cases. Comparison with the (much more scattered) measurements of ice particles falling in air show strong support for this new method, with the area ratio bias apparently eliminated.},

This study uses data from six field campaigns to evaluate this mass\textendash dimensional relationship in a variety of ice cloud types and temperatures and to account for the deviations observed with temperature and size, based on properties of the ice particle ensembles. Although the Brown and Francis relationship provides a good match to the observations in a mean sense, it fails to capture dependences on temperature and particle size that are a result of the complex microphysical processes operative within most ice cloud layers. Mass\textendash dimensional relationships that provide a better fit to the observations are developed.},

The study uses data from 10 field programs spanning the temperature range -86\textdegree{} to 0\textdegree C and encompassing a total of about 800\,000\,km of cloud horizontal pathlengths and includes measurements of ice particle size distributions (PSDs) and direct measurements of the ice water content (IWC). The necessary ice particle variables are derived using variables that are interconnected rather than varying independently from observations reported in the literature. A secondary goal of the study is to quantify the properties of ice cloud particle ensembles over a wide range of temperatures to further the understanding of how ice particle ensembles and ice clouds develop. Functional forms for the PSDs and mass\textendash{} and area\textendash dimensional relationships are developed from the observations and summarized in a table. The PSDs are found to be nearly exponential at temperatures from about -40\textdegree{} to -10\textdegree C although deviations from exponentiality are noted outside of this range. It is demonstrated that previous pressure-dependent corrections to ice fall speeds lead to overestimated terminal velocities for particles smaller than 1\,mm, particularly so for sizes below 100\,{$\mu$}m, with consequent effects on modeled lifetimes of cold ice clouds.},

Cirrus clouds, composed of ice particles, form in the upper troposphere, where temperatures are generally below -30\textdegree C. Satellite observations show that the maximum-occurrence frequency of cirrus is near the tropics, with a large latitudinal movement seasonally. In situ measurements obtained over a wide range of cirrus types, formation mechanisms, temperatures, and geographical locations indicate that the ice water content and particle size generally decrease with decreasing temperature, whereas the ice particle concentration is nearly constant or increases slightly with decreasing temperature. High ice concentrations, sometimes observed in strong updrafts, result from homogeneous nucleation. The satellite-based and in situ measurements indicate that cirrus ice crystals typically differ from the simple, idealized geometry for smooth hexagonal shapes, indicating complexity and/or surface roughness. Their shapes significantly impact cirrus radiative properties and feedbacks to climate. Cirrus clouds, one of the most uncertain components of general circulation models (GCM), pose one of the greatest challenges in predicting the rate and geographical pattern of climate change. Improved measurements of the properties and size distributions and surface structure of small ice crystals (about 20 {$\mu$}m) and identifying the dominant ice nucleation process (heterogeneous versus homogeneous ice nucleation) under different cloud dynamical forcings will lead to a better representation of their properties in GCM and in modeling their current and future effects on climate.},

Previous studies showing tight relationships between deep convection and convective waves mainly focus on tropical latitudes. For midlatitudes most analyses are based on case studies. Here we present a new multiyear occurrence frequency analysis of convective waves at midlatitudes. The study is based on radiance measurements made by the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) satellite experiment during the North American thunderstorm season, May to August, in the years 2003\textendash 2008. For this study we optimized an existing algorithm to detect deep convection in AIRS data to be applicable at midlatitudes. We also present a new detection algorithm for gravity waves in AIRS data based on a variance filter approach for 4.3 {$\mu$}m brightness temperatures. The new algorithm can detect plane wave perturbations in the altitude range from 20 to 65 km with vertical wavelengths larger than 15 km and horizontal wavelengths from 50 to 1000 km. By analyzing spatial and temporal correlations of the individual AIRS observations, it can be shown that more than 95\% of the observed gravity waves in a core region over the North American Great Plains are related to deep convective clouds, i.e., are likely being classified appropriately as convective waves. We conclude that the core region is a good location to observe and characterize the properties of convective waves at midlatitudes. The statistical analyses presented here are also valuable to validate parameterization schemes for convective gravity waves. For completeness, it should be mentioned that our analyses cover not only the U.S. Midwest but the North American continent as well as the surrounding ocean regions in general. Our analysis also reveals interesting details about tropical convection and related gravity wave activity, as well as the capability of the AIRS instrument to observe these.},

In the presence of larger crystals the 94-GHz radar scatters sufficiently beyond the Rayleigh regime that the difference in reflectivity factor measured by the two can be directly related to size. This enables more accurate estimation of ice water content than would be possible using a single radar. The small crystals at the top of the cloud scatter in the Rayleigh regime at both wavelengths, which provides a valuable method of calibration, but also means that sizing is not possible in this part of the cloud. Ice water content and median volume diameter were derived and compared with the analyses of the U.K. Meteorological Office Unified Model. The smallest measurable median volume diameter in this case study was around 200 {$\mu$}m, although it is believed that with both radars sensitive down to -35 dBZ, it should be possible to measure median diameters of 100 {$\mu$}m. Scattering calculations have been carried out to determine the sensitivity of these measurements to crystal density, crystal aspect ratio, and the shape of the size distribution. Density is found to be the most significant source of uncertainty, possibly introducing errors of 20\% into retrieved diameter.},

In this paper a stochastic model is describedthat is capable of simulating the structural properties unique to cirrus: fallstreak geometry and shear-inducedmixing. We first present an analysis of time\textendash height cloud radar sections from southern England to extract the cirrusparameters of interest. It is found that horizontal power spectra of the logarithm of ice-water content (estimatedfrom radar reflectivity factor and temperature) typically exhibit a spectral slope of around-5/3 near cloud topthat decreases with depth into the cloud, to values as low as-3.5 in some cases. This decrease can be explainedby wind shear coupled with a spread of particle fall speeds leading to a homogenization that acts preferentially atsmaller scales. The power spectra exhibit a distinct scale break, becoming flat at scales larger than around 50 km(the `outer scale'). The orientation of the fallstreaks may be predicted from the profile of mean wind and mean icefall speed. We then describe the stochastic model, which takes as input profiles of the mean and fractional standarddeviation of ice-water content, spectral slope, outer scale and wind speed. It first generates an isotropic 3-D fractalfield by performing an inverse 3-D Fourier transform on a matrix of simulated Fourier coefficients with amplitudesconsistent with the observed 1-D spectra. Random phases forthe coefficients allow multiple realizations of a cloudwith the same statistical properties to be generated. Then horizontal slices from the domain are manipulated inturn to simulate horizontal displacement and changes to the spectra with height. Finally the field is scaled toproduce the observed mean and fractional standard deviation of ice-water content. Vertical 2-D slices extractedfrom the domain are very similar in appearance to cloud radar observations. Radiative-transfer calculations usingthe independent column approximation are used to show that the different fallstreak orientation resulting fromdifferent wind shears can change mean top-of-atmosphere radiative fluxes by in excess of 45 W m-2in the short-waveand15Wm-2in the long-wave. The effect of wind shear to induce horizontal mixingcauses an additionalbut smaller radiative effect. We also investigate the biases that would be expected from the assumptions made inthe radiation schemes of general-circulation models (GCMs). It is found that there is some compensation betweenthe errors arising from the assumptions of horizontal homogeneity and maximum-random overlap; if a GCM wereto improve the overlap assumption but still assume cloudsto be horizontally homogeneous then the total error incloud radiative effect would be likely to increase.},

  abstract = {A technique is described to retrieve stratocumulus liquid water content (LWC) using the differential attenuation measured by vertically pointing radars at 35 and 94 GHz. Millimeter-wave attenuation is proportional to LWC and increases with frequency, so LWC can be derived without the need to make any assumptions on the nature of the droplet size distribution. There is also no need for the radars to be well calibrated. A significant advantage over many radar techniques in stratocumulus is that the presence of drizzle drops (those with a diameter larger than around 50 {$\mu$}m) does not affect the retrieval, even though such drops may dominate the radar signal. It is important, however, that there are not significant numbers of drops larger than 600 {$\mu$}m, which scatter outside of the Rayleigh regime at 94 GHz. A lidar ceilometer is used to locate the cloud base in the presence of drizzle falling below the cloud. An accuracy of around 0.04 g m-3 is achievable with averaging over 1 min and 150 m (two range gates), but for the previously suggested frequency pair of 10 and 35 GHz, the corresponding accuracy would be considerably worse at 0.34 g m-3. First, the retrieval of LWC is simulated using aircraft-measured size spectra taken from a profile through marine stratocumulus. Results are then presented from two case studies\textemdash one using two cloud radars at Chilbolton in southern United Kingdom, and another using the Cloud Profiling Radar System at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in Oklahoma. The liquid water path from the technique was found to be in good agreement with the values that were obtained from microwave radiometers, with the difference between the two being close to the accuracy of the radiometer retrieval.

  abstract = {Abstract A fast, approximate method is described for the calculation of the intensity of multiply scattered lidar returns from clouds. At each range gate it characterizes the outgoing photon distribution by its spatial variance, the variance of photon direction, and the covariance of photon direction and position. The result is that for an N-point profile the calculation is O(N) efficient yet it implicitly includes all orders of scattering, in contrast with the O(Nm/m!) efficiency of models that explicitly consider each scattering order separately for truncation at m-order scattering. It is also shown how the shape of the scattering phase function near 180\textdegree{} may be taken into account for both liquid water droplets and ice particles. The model considers only multiple scattering due to small-angle forward-scattering events, which is suitable for most ground-based and airborne lidars because of their small footprint on the cloud. For spaceborne lidar, it must be used in combination with the wide-angle multiple scattering model described in Part II of this two-part paper.},

  abstract = {Abstract The assumed relationship between ice particle mass and size is profoundly important in radar retrievals of ice clouds, but, for millimeter-wave radars, shape and preferred orientation are important as well. In this paper the authors first examine the consequences of the fact that the widely used ``Brown and Francis'' mass\textendash size relationship has often been applied to maximum particle dimension observed by aircraft Dmax rather than to the mean of the particle dimensions in two orthogonal directions Dmean, which was originally used by Brown and Francis. Analysis of particle images reveals that Dmax {$\simeq$} 1.25Dmean, and therefore, for clouds for which this mass\textendash size relationship holds, the consequences are overestimates of ice water content by around 53\% and of Rayleigh-scattering radar reflectivity factor by 3.7 dB. Simultaneous radar and aircraft measurements demonstrate that much better agreement in reflectivity factor is provided by using this mass\textendash size relationship with Dmean. The authors then examine the importance of particle shape and fall orientation for millimeter-wave radars. Simultaneous radar measurements and aircraft calculations of differential reflectivity and dual-wavelength ratio are presented to demonstrate that ice particles may usually be treated as horizontally aligned oblate spheroids with an axial ratio of 0.6, consistent with them being aggregates. An accurate formula is presented for the backscatter cross section apparent to a vertically pointing millimeter-wave radar on the basis of a modified version of Rayleigh\textendash Gans theory. It is then shown that the consequence of treating ice particles as Mie-scattering spheres is to substantially underestimate millimeter-wave reflectivity factor when millimeter-sized particles are present, which can lead to retrieved ice water content being overestimated by a factor of 4.},

It uses the Rayleigh\textendash Gans approximation, which has previously been found to be applicable at these wavelengths due to the low density of snow aggregates. Although the internal structure of an individual snowflake is random and unpredictable, the authors find from simulations of the aggregation process that their structure is ``self-similar'' and can be described by a power law. This enables an analytic expression to be derived for the backscatter cross section of an ensemble of particles as a function of their maximum dimension in the direction of propagation of the radiation, the volume of ice they contain, a variable describing their mean shape, and two variables describing the shape of the power spectrum. The exponent of the power law is found to be -. In the case of 1-cm snowflakes observed by a 3.2-mm-wavelength radar, the backscatter is 40\textendash 100 times larger than that of a homogeneous ice\textendash air spheroid with the same mass, size, and aspect ratio.}

This two-part paper describes the development of such a scheme, which we refer to as the Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides (SPARTACUS). The principle of the method is to add extra terms to the two-stream equations to represent lateral transport between clear and cloudy regions, which vary in proportion to the length of cloud edge as a function of height. The present paper describes a robust and accurate method for solving the coupled system of equations in both the shortwave and longwave in terms of matrix exponentials. This solver has been coupled to a correlated-k model for gas absorption. We then confirm the accuracy of SPARTACUS by performing broadband comparisons with fully 3-D radiation calculations by the Monte Carlo model ``MYSTIC'' for a cumulus cloud field, examining particularly the percentage change in cloud radiative effect (CRE) when 3-D effects are introduced. In the shortwave, SPARTACUS correctly captures this change to CRE, which varies with solar zenith angle between -25\% and +120\%. In the longwave, SPARTACUS captures well the increase in radiative cooling of the cloud, although it is only able to correctly simulate the 30\% increase in surface CRE (around 4 W m-2) if an approximate correction is made for cloud clustering.},

The available solvers include the Monte Carlo Independent Column Approximation (McICA), Tripleclouds, and the Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides (SPARTACUS), the latter which makes ECMWF the first global model capable of representing the 3-D radiative effects of clouds. The new implementation of the operational McICA solver produces less noise in atmospheric heating rates, and is 41\% faster, which can yield indirect forecast skill improvements via calling the radiation scheme more frequently. We demonstrate how longwave scattering may be implemented for clouds but not aerosols, which is only 4\% more computationally costly overall than neglecting longwave scattering and yields further modest forecast improvements. It is also shown how a sequence of radiation changes in the last few years has led to a substantial reduction in stratospheric temperature biases.},

  abstract = {Several mechanisms have previously been proposed to explain differences between the shortwave reflectance of realistic cloud scenes computed using the 1D independent column approximation (ICA) and 3D solutions of the radiative transfer equation. When the sun is low in the sky, interception of sunlight by cloud sides tends to increase reflectance relative to ICA estimates that neglect this effect. When the sun is high, 3D radiative transfer tends to make clouds less reflective, which we argue is explained by the mechanism of ``entrapment'' whereby horizontal transport of radiation beneath a cloud layer increases the chances, relative to the ICA, of light being absorbed by cloud or the surface. It is especially important for multilayered cloud scenes. We describe modifications to the previously described Speedy Algorithm for Radiative Transfer through Cloud Sides (SPARTACUS) to represent different entrapment assumptions, and test their impact on 65 contrasting scenes from a cloud-resolving model. When entrapment is represented explicitly via a calculation of the mean horizontal distance traveled by reflected light, SPARTACUS predicts a mean ``3D radiative effect'' (the difference in top-of-atmosphere irradiances between 3D and ICA calculations) of 8.1 W m-2 for overhead sun. This is within 2\% of broadband Monte Carlo calculations on the same scenes. The importance of entrapment is highlighted by the finding that the extreme assumptions in SPARTACUS of ``zero entrapment'' and ``maximum entrapment'' lead to corresponding mean 3D radiative effects of 1.7 and 19.6 W m-2, respectively.},

Results show that the global-mean ice cloud optical depth, ice water path, and effective radius are approximately 2, 109 g m-2, and 48 , respectively. Ice cloud occurrence frequency varies depending not only on regions and seasons, but also on the types of ice clouds as defined by optical depth values. Ice clouds with different values show differently preferential locations on the planet; optically thinner ones ( {$<$} 3) are most frequently observed in the tropics around 15 km and in midlatitudes below 5 km, while thicker ones ( {$>$} 3) occur frequently in tropical convective areas and along midlatitude storm tracks. It is also found that ice water content and effective radius show different temperature dependence among the tropics, midlatitudes, and high latitudes. Based on analyzed ice cloud frequencies and microphysical properties, cloud radiative forcing is evaluated using a radiative transfer model. The results show that globally radiative forcing due to ice clouds introduces a net warming of the earth\textendash atmosphere system. Those with {$<$} 4.0 all have a positive (warming) net forcing with the largest contribution by ice clouds with 1.2. Regionally, ice clouds in high latitudes show a warming effect throughout the year, while they cause cooling during warm seasons but warming during cold seasons in midlatitudes. Ice cloud properties revealed in this study enhance the understanding of ice cloud climatology and can be used for validating climate models.},

  abstract = {A small subset of the atmospheric aerosol population has the ability to induce ice formation at conditions under which ice would not form without them (heterogeneous ice nucleation). While no closed theoretical description of this process and the requirements for good ice nuclei is available, numerous studies have attempted to quantify the ice nucleation ability of different particles empirically in laboratory experiments. In this article, an overview of these results is provided. Ice nucleation "onset" conditions for various mineral dust, soot, biological, organic and ammonium sulfate particles are summarized. Typical temperature-supersaturation regions can be identified for the "onset" of ice nucleation of these different particle types, but the various particle sizes and activated fractions reported in different studies have to be taken into account when comparing results obtained with different methodologies. When intercomparing only data obtained under the same conditions, it is found that dust mineralogy is not a consistent predictor of higher or lower ice nucleation ability. However, the broad majority of studies agrees on a reduction of deposition nucleation by various coatings on mineral dust. The ice nucleation active surface site (INAS) density is discussed as a simple and empirical normalized measure for ice nucleation activity. For most immersion and condensation freezing measurements on mineral dust, estimates of the temperature-dependent INAS density agree within about two orders of magnitude. For deposition nucleation on dust, the spread is significantly larger, but a general trend of increasing INAS densities with increasing supersaturation is found. For soot, the presently available results are divergent. Estimated average INAS densities are high for ice-nucleation active bacteria at high subzero temperatures. At the same time, it is shown that INAS densities of some other biological aerosols, like certain pollen grains, fungal spores and diatoms, tend to be similar to those of dust. These particles may owe their high ice nucleation onsets to their large sizes. Surface-area-dependent parameterizations of heterogeneous ice nucleation are discussed. For immersion freezing on mineral dust, fitted INAS densities are available, but should not be used outside the temperature interval of the data they were based on. Classical nucleation theory, if employed with only one fitted contact angle, does not reproduce the observed temperature dependence for immersion nucleation, the temperature and supersaturation dependence for deposition nucleation, and the time dependence of ice nucleation. Formulations of classical nucleation theory with distributions of contact angles offer possibilities to overcome these weaknesses.},

The algorithm is similar to the one described in part 1 of this series of studies: spectral angular dependent models are developed to estimate the spectral flux of each AIRS channel, and then a multivariate linear prediction scheme is used to estimate spectral fluxes at frequencies not covered by the AIRS instrument. The entire algorithm is validated against synthetic spectra as well as the CERES outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) measurements. Mean difference between the OLR estimated in this way and the collocated CERES OLR is 2.15 W m-2 with a standard deviation of 5.51 W m-2. The algorithm behaves consistently well for different combinations of cloud fractions and cloud-surface temperature difference, indicating the robustness of the algorithm for various cloudy scenes. Then, using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory AM2 model as a case study, we illustrate the merit of band-by-band cloud radiative forcings (CRFs) derived from this algorithm in model evaluation. The AM2 tropical annual mean band-by-band CRFs generally agree with the observed counterparts, but some systematic biases in the window bands and over the marine-stratus regions can be clearly identified. An idealized model is used to interpret the results and to explain why the fractional contribution of each band to the broadband CRF is worthy for studying: it is sensitive to cloud height but largely insensitive to the cloud fraction.},

There is, however, a sizeable gap between the abstract formulae related to electromagnetic-wave-scattering phenomena, and the computation of reliable figures and curves. Dr. van de Hulst\&\#39;s book enables researchers to bridge that gap. The product of twelve years of work, it is an exhaustive study of light-scattering properties of small, individual particles, and includes a survey of all the relevant literature. Beginning with a broad overview of basic scattering theory, Dr. van de Hulst covers the conservation of energy and momentum; wave propagation in vacuum and in a medium containing scatterers; and polarized light and symmetry relations. The heart of the book is devoted to the rigorous scattering theory for spheres of arbitrary size (Mie theory) and to various modes of approximation such as the Rayleigh-Gaas approximation, the perfect reflection approximation, the geometrical-optics approximation, and others. Methods of computation are given with respect to different kinds of particles, bodies and phenomena: particles small or very large compared to the wavelength, absorbing and nonabsorbing spheres, water drops, circular cylinders, edge phenomena and surface waves, and many others. In the last part, the author covers the use of scattering and extinction experiments as a practical tool, including applications in chemistry, meteorology and astronomy. This book\&\#39;s comprehensive, lucid coverage of the field makes it a valuable source for all those interested in light-scattering theory. It is absolutely essential for researchers needing to employ light-scattering measurements, and its republication will be welcomed especially by those who have found this necessary source difficult to obtain.

  abstract = {The Southern Ocean is a pivotal component of the global climate system yet it is poorly represented in climate models, with significant biases in upper-ocean temperatures, clouds and winds. Combining Atmospheric and Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (AMIP5/CMIP5) simulations, with observations and equilibrium heat budget theory, we show that across the CMIP5 ensemble variations in sea surface temperature biases in the 40\textendash 60\textdegree S Southern Ocean are primarily caused by AMIP5 atmospheric model net surface flux bias variations, linked to cloud-related short-wave errors. Equilibration of the biases involves local coupled sea surface temperature bias feedbacks onto the surface heat flux components. In combination with wind feedbacks, these biases adversely modify upper-ocean thermal structure. Most AMIP5 atmospheric models that exhibit small net heat flux biases appear to achieve this through compensating errors. We demonstrate that targeted developments to cloud-related parameterisations provide a route to better represent the Southern Ocean in climate models and projections.},

In the models, the properties of clouds are simplified and expressed in terms of the fraction of the model grid box, which is filled with cloud, together with the liquid and ice water content of the clouds. These models must get the clouds right if they are to correctly represent both their radiative properties and their key role in the production of precipitation, but there are few observations of the vertical profiles of the cloud properties that show whether or not they are successful. Cloud profiles derived from cloud radars, ceilometers, and dual-frequency microwave radiometers operated at three sites in France, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom for several years have been compared with the clouds in seven European models. The advantage of this continuous appraisal is that the feedback on how new versions of models are performing is provided in quasi-real time, as opposed to the much longer time scale needed for in-depth analysis of complex field studies. Here, two occasions are identified when the introduction of new versions of the ECMWF and M\'et\'eo-France models leads to an immediate improvement in the representation of the clouds and also provides statistics on the performance of the seven models. The Cloudnet analysis scheme is currently being expanded to include sites outside Europe and further operational forecasting and climate models.},

This reanalysis provides fields of chemically reactive gases, namely carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen oxides, and formaldehyde, as well as aerosols and greenhouse gases globally at a horizontal resolution of about 80 km for both the troposphere and the stratosphere.

In the troposphere the reanalysis shows biases of -5\% to +10\% with respect to ozonesondes and aircraft data in the extratropics, but has larger negative biases in the tropics. Area-averaged total column ozone agrees with ozone fields from a multi-sensor reanalysis data set to within a few percent. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} NO\textsubscript{2} fields from the reanalysis show the right seasonality over polluted urban areas of the NH and over tropical biomass burning areas, but underestimate wintertime NO\textsubscript{2} maxima over anthropogenic pollution regions and overestimate NO\textsubscript{2} in northern and southern Africa during the tropical biomass burning seasons. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$} Tropospheric HCHO is well simulated in the MACC reanalysis even though no satellite data are assimilated.

The radar/lidar combination was necessary for comprehensive cloud detection over a variety of physical conditions and is significantly more detailed (5\textendash 9 s temporal resolution, 30\textendash 40 m vertical resolution) than measurements made by surface observers or satellites. The combined measurements revealed that clouds were almost continuously present, with an annual average occurrence of 85\%, and displayed an overall annual trend of a cloudier summer and clearer winter. A monthly averaged cloud occurrence maximum of 97\% was observed in September and a minimum of 63\% was observed in February. Monthly averaged lowest cloud base heights were between 0.25 and 1.0 km above ground level (agl) and monthly averaged highest cloud top heights were between 2.5 and 5.5 km agl, and displayed no significant seasonal variation. The number of cloud layers was typically 1 or 2, with the summer months tending to be multilayered. The lidar utilized depolarization ratios to detect liquid water; the percentage of lidar-observed clouds containing liquid was 73\% for the year. The least amount of liquid water phase was observed during December in 25\% of the lidar-detected clouds and the maximum was observed during July in 95\% of the lidar-detected clouds. Liquid was distributed in a combination of all-liquid and mixed phase clouds, and was detected at altitudes as high as 6.5 km agl and at temperatures as low as -34\textdegree C.},

The motivation is to provide a set of weather types to facilitate an investigation of climate-optimal aircraft routing of trans-Atlantic flights (minimizing the climate impact on a flight-by-flight basis). Using the New York to London route as an example, the time-optimal route times are shown to vary by over 60 min, to take advantage of strong tailwinds or avoid headwinds, and for eastbound routes latitude correlates well with the latitude of the jet stream. The weather patterns are classified by their similarity to the North Atlantic Oscillation and East Atlantic teleconnection patterns. For winter, five types are defined; in summer, when there is less variation in jet latitude, only three types are defined. The types can be characterized by the jet strength and position, and therefore the location of the time-optimal routes varies by type. Simple proxies for the climate impact of carbon dioxide, ozone, water vapour and contrails are defined, which depend on parameters such as the route time, latitude and season, the time spent flying in the stratosphere, and the distance over which the air is supersaturated with respect to ice. These proxies are then shown to vary between weather types and between eastbound and westbound routes.},

In spite of the potentially large effects, state-of-the-art numerical models usually do not represent landfast ice in its correct extent. A simple parametrization of landfast ice based on bathymetry and internal sea ice strength is introduced and its effects on the simulated Arctic Ocean are demonstrated. The simulations suggest that the Siberian landfast ice impacts the Arctic halocline stability through enhanced brine production in polynyas located closer to the shelf break and by redirecting river water to the Canadian Basin. These processes strengthen the halocline in the Canadian Basin, but erode its stability in the Makarov and Eurasian Basins.},

Instead of using separate independent algorithms for different cloud properties, a unified, optimal estimation-based cloud retrieval algorithm is developed and applied to moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) observations using ten thermal infrared bands. The model considers sensor configurations, background surface and atmospheric profile, and microphysical and optical models of ice and liquid cloud particles and radiative transfer in a plane-parallel, multilayered atmosphere. Measurement and model errors are thoroughly quantified from direct comparisons of clear-sky observations over the ocean with model calculations. Performance tests by retrieval simulations show that ice cloud properties are retrieved with high accuracy when cloud optical thickness (COT) is between 0.1 and 10. Cloud-top pressure is inferred with uncertainty lower than 10 \% when COT is larger than 0.3. Applying the method to a tropical cloud system and comparing the results with the MODIS Collection 6 cloud product shows good agreement for ice cloud optical thickness when COT is less than about 5. Cloud-top height agrees well with estimates obtained by the CO2 slicing method used in the MODIS product. The present algorithm can detect optically thin parts at the edges of high clouds well in comparison with the MODIS product, in which these parts are recognized as low clouds by the infrared window method. The cloud thermodynamic phase in the present algorithm is constrained by cloud-top temperature, which tends not to produce results with an ice cloud that is too warm and liquid cloud that is too cold.},

The AFDM utilizes the diode array technique and measures downwelling and upwelling spectral actinic flux densities separately with a time resolution of less than 1 s. For airborne measurements this means a spatial resolution of 60 m, assuming an average aircraft velocity of 60 m/s. Thus the AFDM resolves fast changes in the actinic radiation field, which are of special importance for conditions of inhomogeneous clouds or surface reflection. Laboratory characterization measurements of the AFDM are presented, and a method to correct the nonideal angular response of the optical inlets is introduced. Furthermore, exemplar field data sampled simultaneously with spectral irradiance measurements are shown. The horizontal variability of the measured spectra of actinic flux density is quantified, and profile measurements for overcast situations are presented. Finally, the effects of clouds on the spectral actinic flux density are discussed.},

Therefore, this work studies the effects of the heterogeneity of surface reflectivity on the area-averaged surface albedo to quantify how well aircraft measurements can resolve the small-scale variability of the local surface albedo. For that purpose spatially heterogeneous surface albedo maps were input into a 3-dimensional (3-D) Monte Carlo radiative transfer model to simulate 3-D irradiance fields. The calculated up- and downward irradiances in altitudes between 0.1 and 5 km are used to derive the area-averaged surface albedo using an iterative retrieval method that removes the effects due to atmospheric scattering and absorption within the layer beneath the considered level. For the case of adjacent land and sea surfaces, parametrizations are presented which quantify the horizontal distance from the coastline that is required to reduce surface heterogeneity effects on the area-averaged surface albedo to a given limit. The parametrization which is a function of altitude, aerosol optical depth, single scattering albedo, and the ratio of local land and sea albedo was applied for airborne spectral measurements. In addition, the deviation between area-averaged and local surface albedo is determined for more complex surface albedo maps. For moderate aerosol conditions (optical depth less than 0.4) and a wavelength range between 400 and 1000 nm, the altitude and the heterogeneity of the surface albedo are the dominant factors determining the mean deviation between local and area-averaged surface albedo. A parametrization of the mean deviation is applied to an albedo map that was derived from a Landsat image of an area in East Anglia (UK). Parametrization and direct comparison of local and area-averaged surface albedo show similar mean deviations (20\% vs. 25\%) over land.},

  abstract = {The formation of shallow cumulus cloud streets was historically attributed primarily to dynamics. Here, we focus on the interaction between radiatively induced surface heterogeneities and the resulting patterns in the flow. Our results suggest that solar radiative heating has the potential to organize clouds perpendicular to the sun's incidence angle. To quantify the extent of organization, we performed a high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) parameter study. We varied the horizontal wind speed, the surface heat capacity, the solar zenith and azimuth angles, and radiative transfer parameterizations (1-D and 3-D). As a quantitative measure we introduce a simple algorithm that provides a scalar quantity for the degree of organization and the alignment. We find that, even in the absence of a horizontal wind, 3-D radiative transfer produces cloud streets perpendicular to the sun's incident direction, whereas the 1-D approximation or constant surface fluxes produce randomly positioned circular clouds. Our reasoning for the enhancement or reduction of organization is the geometric position of the cloud's shadow and its corresponding surface fluxes. Furthermore, when increasing horizontal wind speeds to 5 or 10 m s-1, we observe the development of dynamically induced cloud streets. If, in addition, solar radiation illuminates the surface beneath the cloud, i.e., when the sun is positioned orthogonally to the mean wind field and the solar zenith angle is larger than 20\textdegree, the cloud-radiative feedback has the potential to significantly enhance the tendency to organize in cloud streets. In contrast, in the case of the 1-D approximation (or overhead sun), the tendency to organize is weaker or even prohibited because the shadow is cast directly beneath the cloud. In a land-surface-type situation, we find the organization of convection happening on a timescale of half an hour. The radiative feedback, which creates surface heterogeneities, is generally diminished for large surface heat capacities. We therefore expect radiative feedbacks to be strongest over land surfaces and weaker over the ocean. Given the results of this study we expect that simulations including shallow cumulus convection will have difficulties producing cloud streets if they employ 1-D radiative transfer solvers or may need unrealistically high wind speeds to excite cloud street organization.},

Although there is growing evidence that atmospheric ice crystals are rarely pristine, direct in situ observations of the degree of ice crystal complexity are largely missing. Here we show a comprehensive in situ data set of ice crystal complexity coupled with measurements of the cloud angular scattering functions collected during a number of observational airborne campaigns at diverse geographical locations. Our results demonstrate that an overwhelming fraction (between 61\&thinsp;\% and 81\&thinsp;\%) of atmospheric ice crystals sampled in the different regions contain mesoscopic deformations and, as a consequence, a similar flat and featureless angular scattering function is observed. A comparison between the measurements and a database of optical particle properties showed that severely roughened hexagonal aggregates optimally represent the measurements in the observed angular range. Based on this optical model, a new parameterization of the cloud bulk asymmetry factor was introduced and its effects were tested in a global climate model. The modelling results suggest that, due to ice crystal complexity, ice-containing clouds can induce an additional short-wave cooling effect of -1.12\&thinsp;W\&thinsp;m2 on the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative budget that has not yet been considered.},

  abstract = {Homogeneous freezing of sulfate aerosols may dominate ice nucleation in cirrus, implying that large supersaturations are required for cirrus cloud initiation at low temperatures. However, insoluble particles from the surface or soot particles injected directly into the upper troposphere by jet aircraft may act as heterogeneous ice nuclei. If the soot particles are sufficiently effective ice nuclei, then they will allow ice nucleation at lower supersaturations than those required for homogeneous freezing, resulting in an increase in the areal coverage of cirrus clouds. Simulations using a detailed ice cloud model indicate that cirrus driven by slow, steady lifting (a few cm-s-1) will be transient, precipitating clouds if only pure sulfate haze aerosols are present. However, if effective heterogeneous nuclei are present, then extensive, persistent, diffuse cirrus should form. In addition, heterogeneous ice nucleation on insoluble particles may modify the number of ice crystals nucleated in cirrus, resulting in alterations of the cloud evolution and radiative properties. Heterogeneous freezing on relatively few insoluble particles (Ninv {$<$}0.1 cm-3) should result in fewer ice crystals nucleating than if homogeneous freezing were to occur. However, if large numbers of insoluble particles are present, the ice crystal number density may be increased.},

The intrusions also lead to additional cloud radiative heating of up to 0.15 K/d via up to 30\% increased cloudiness in the vertical and also cause a weakening of the stability in the lower troposphere.

One algorithm is based on the 85 GHz polarization difference. The second algorithm is the NASA Team algorithm using the 19 and 37 GHz SSM/I channels. Using 85 GHz SSM/I data allows a significant resolution improvement compared to 19 GHz SSM/I data. This, however, requires careful consideration of the larger atmospheric opacity affecting SSM/I measurements at 85 GHz (weather influence) which can lead to incorrect sea ice concentration estimates - particularly over open water. Our scheme combines the high spatial resolution achieved with the 85 GHz channels with the almost weather-independently NTA-based decision whether the data points belong to the ice-free ocean or to the ice-covered area. Reference 85 GHz brightness temperatures (tie points) have been estimated using a statistical linear regression method with the aid of independent sea ice concentration reference data. These were derived from aircraft dual-polarized passive microwave measurements at 19 and 37 GHz and optical line scanner images. The evaluation of 30 days of SSM/I data comparing the NTA and 85 GHz ice concentrations indicates a good agreement and a strong linear relationship. ERS-2 SAR and SSM/I data were used to analyze the evolution of the Storfjorden Polynya and the MIZ in the Fram Strait. Two different numerical atmospheric models were used to analyze the effect of a resolution improvement from 50 to 12 km of the sea ice concentration data prescribed to model the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). It was found that the representation of the MIZ substantially influences the modelled ABL temperatures. Temperature profiles obtained with the model using the high resolution sea ice concentration data agree significantly better with the profiles measured by the aircraft.},

Dynamical properties of ice clouds can be determined via Doppler measurements from ground-based, profiling cloud radars. Here, the decomposition of the Doppler velocities into reflectivity-weighted particle velocity Vt and vertical air motion w is described. The methodology is applied to high clouds observations from 35-GHz profiling millimeter wavelength radars at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) climate research facility in Oklahoma (January 1997\textendash December 2010) and the ARM Tropical Western Pacific (TWP) site in Manus (July 1999\textendash December 2010). The Doppler velocity measurements are used to detect gravity waves (GW), whose correlation with high cloud macrophysical properties is investigated. Cloud turbulence is studied in the absence and presence of GW. High clouds are less turbulent when GW are observed. Probability density functions of Vt, w, and high cloud macrophysical properties for the two cloud subsets (with and without GW) are presented. Air-density-corrected Vt for high clouds for which GW (no GW) were detected amounted to hourly means and standard deviations of 0.89 {$\pm$} 0.52 m s-1 (0.8 {$\pm$} 0.48 m s-1) and 1.03 {$\pm$} 0.41 m s-1 (0.86 {$\pm$} 0.49 m s-1) at SGP and Manus, respectively. The error of w at one standard deviation was estimated as 0.15 m s-1. Hourly means of w averaged around 0 m s-1 with standard deviations of {$\pm$}0.27 (SGP) and {$\pm$}0.29 m s-1 (Manus) for high clouds without GW and {$\pm$}0.22 m s-1 (both sites) for high clouds with GW.

By removing the vertical air motion from Vd, the power law can be rewritten as Vt = aZb with Vt being the reflectivity-weighted particle terminal fall velocity. Profiles of this relation are variable with height. An attempt was made to relate this variability to the dominant microphysical processes in different layers of the cloud. Based on that, the possibility of using profiles of the parameters a and b to distinguish different microphysical regimes was explored. The methodology was applied to long-term measurements (January 1997 to December 2010) at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site in the Southern Great Plains. Principal component analysis was used to determine the modes of the profiles that explain most of the observed variance in the observations. Profile-averaged means and standard deviations of parameters a and b amounted to 0.65 {$\pm$} 0.42 and 0.03 {$\pm$} 0.19, respectively. Furthermore, three commonly used microphysical relations related to bulk quantities were used to determine values of a and b. These results were found to compare reasonably well with the values obtained from the radar observations. Finally, microphysical considerations showed that radar-derived values of parameter b can be explained in terms of particle size distribution moment changes.},

The presented analysis of the height evolution of the radar Doppler spectra is a state-of-the-art retrieval with profiling cloud radars in SLW layers beyond the traditional use of spectral moments. Dynamical effects are considered by following the particle population evolution along slanted tracks that are caused by horizontal advection of the cloud under wind shear conditions. In the SLW layer, the identified liquid peak is used as an air motion tracer to correct the Doppler spectra for vertical air motion and the ice peak is used to study the radar profiles of rimed particles. A 1-D steady-state bin microphysical model is constrained using the SLW and air motion profiles and cloud top radar observations. The observed radar moment profiles of the rimed snow can be simulated reasonably well by the model, but not without making several assumptions about the ice particle concentration and the relative role of deposition and aggregation. This suggests that in situ observations of key ice properties are needed to complement the profiling radar observations before process-oriented studies can effectively evaluate ice microphysical parameterizations.},

For a springtime low-level mixed-phase stratiform cloud case from Barrow, Alaska, a unique combination of instruments and retrieval methods is combined with multiple modeling perspectives to determine key processes that control cloud phase partitioning. The interplay of local cloud-scale versus large-scale processes is considered. Rapid changes in phase partitioning were found to be caused by several main factors. Major influences were the large-scale advection of different air masses with different aerosol concentrations and humidity content, cloud-scale processes such as a change in the thermodynamical coupling state, and local-scale dynamics influencing the residence time of ice particles. Other factors such as radiative shielding by a cirrus and the influence of the solar cycle were found to only play a minor role for the specific case study (11\textendash 12 March 2013). For an even better understanding of cloud phase transitions, observations of key aerosol parameters such as profiles of cloud condensation nucleus and ice nucleus concentration are desirable.},

  abstract = {In many types of clouds, multiple hydrometeor populations can be present at the same time and height. Studying theevolution of these different hydrometeors in a time-height perspective can give valuable information on cloud particle compositionand microphysical growth processes. However, as a prerequisite, the number of different hydrometeor types in a certaincloud volume needs to be quantified. This can be accomplished using cloud radar Doppler velocity spectra from profilingcloud radars if the different hydrometeor types have sufficiently different terminal fall velocities to produce individual Dopplerspectrum peaks. Here we present a newly developed supervised machine learning radar Doppler spectra peak finding algorithm(named PEAKO). In this approach, three adjustable parameters (spectrum smoothing span, prominence threshold, and minimumpeak width at half-height) are varied to obtain the set of parameters which yields the best agreement of user-classifiedand machine-marked peaks. The algorithm was developed for Ka-band ARM Zenith-pointing Radar (KAZR) observations obtained in thick snow fall systems during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) mobile facility AMF2deployment at Hyyti\"al\"a, Finland, during the Biogenic Aerosols \textendash{} Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign. Theperformance of PEAKO is evaluated by comparing its results to existing Doppler peak finding algorithms. The new algorithmis found to perform well. Its advantage is that the detected features are less noisy and more consistent in time and height thanthe peak finding results of other algorithms. In the future, the PEAKO algorithm will be adapted to other cloud radars and other types of clouds consisting of multiple hydrometeors in the same cloud volume.},

  abstract = {The occurrence of supercooled liquid water in mixed-phase cloud (MPC) affects their cloud microphysical and radiative properties. The prevalence of MPCs in the mid- and high latitudes translates these effects to significant contributions to Earth's radiative balance and hydrological cycle. The current study develops and assesses a radar-only, moment-based phase partition technique for the demarcation of supercooled liquid water volumes in arctic, MPC conditions. The study utilizes observations from the Ka band profiling radar, the collocated high spectral resolution lidar, and ambient temperature profiles from radio sounding deployments following a statistical analysis of 5.5 years of data (January 2014\textendash May 2019) from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement observatory at the North Slope of Alaska. The ice/liquid phase partition occurs via a per-pixel, neighborhood-dependent algorithm based on the premise that the partitioning can be deduced by examining the mean values of locally sampled probability distributions of radar-based observables and then compare those against the means of climatologically derived, per-phase probability distributions. Analyzed radar observables include linear depolarization ratio (LDR), spectral width, and vertical gradients of reflectivity factor and radial velocity corrected for vertical air motion. Results highlight that the optimal supercooled liquid water detection skill levels are realized for the radar variable combination of spectral width and reflectivity vertical gradient, suggesting that radar-based polarimetry, in the absence of full LDR spectra, is not as critical as Doppler capabilities. The cloud phase masking technique is proven particularly reliable when applied to cloud tops with an Equitable Threat Score (ETS) of 65\%; the detection of embedded supercooled layers remains much more uncertain (ETS = 27\%).},

This study investigates the CRE of multi-layered clouds in TWP via a radiative transfer model, Streamer. We assumed that multi-layered clouds are composed of full coverage of high clouds overlying low clouds with fractional coverage. The simulation results show that low clouds readily change CREs from positive to negative in the case of optically thin high clouds, even if the fraction of low clouds takes 10\% of that of high clouds. Also, various combinations of physical properties of multi-layered high and low clouds allow more CRE variability (- 253.76 to 93.10 W m-2) than single-layered clouds do (- 101.62 to 96.95 W m-2). Even in the same conditions (total column cloud optical thickness = 15 and high cloud top pressure = 200 hPa), the multi-layer clouds have various CREs from - 180.55 to 45.64 W m-2, while the single-layer high clouds - 2.00 W m-2. These findings are also comparable with satellite observations from CERES and CALIPSO. The present study suggests that considerable uncertainty of radiative effects of high clouds over TWP can attribute to low clouds below high clouds.},

By comparing these observations with an 11\textendash year cloud data set measured with a lidar at Leipzig (51\textdegree N), Germany, the occurrence of heterogeneous ice formation (as a function of cloud top temperature) for very different aerosol conditions in the northern and southern hemisphere is investigated. Large differences in the heterogeneous freezing behavior in the mostly layered clouds are found. For example, {$<$}20\%, 30\%\textendash 40\% and around 70\% of the cloud layers with cloud top temperatures from -15\textdegree C to -20\textdegree C, showed ice formation over Punta Arenas, Stellenbosch, and Leipzig, respectively. The observed strong contrast reflects the differences in the free tropospheric aerosol conditions at northern midlatitudes, that are controlled by anthropogenic pollution, mineral dust, forest fire smoke, terrestrial biological material and high southern midlatitudes with clean marine conditions.},

The analysis explains the dependence of the number density of ice crystals on the vertical velocity and temperature seen in numerical simulations of cirrus formation when the timescale of depositional growth of the pristine ice particles is fast compared to the timescale of the freezing event. In such cases, applicable in many situations, the number of crystals formed via homogeneous freezing of aqueous solution droplets is rather insensitive to details of the aerosol size distribution, but increases rapidly with updraft velocity and decreases with temperature. The derived parameterization is validated with parcel model simulations, and its applicability for use in climate models is discussed. The potential role of aerosol size and heterogeneous freezing processes in altering the predicted cirrus properties is briefly addressed.},

  abstract = {The probability of occurrence of ice crystal number densities in young cirrus clouds is examined based on airborne measurements. The observations have been carried out at midlatitudes in both hemispheres at equivalent latitudes (52-55\textdegree N/S) during the same season (local autumn in 2000). The in situ measurements considered in the present study include temperatures, vertical velocities, and total ice crystal concentrations, the latter determined with high precision and accuracy using a counterflow virtual impactor. Most young cirrus clouds typically contain high number densities (1-10 cm-3) of small (diameter {$<$}20 mm) ice crystals. This mode dominates the probability distributions and is shown to be caused by rapid cooling rates associated with updraft speeds in the range 10-100 cm s-1. A second mode containing larger crystals extends from 1 cm-3 to low concentrations close to the detection threshold ( 3 x 10-4 cm-3) and could be associated with lower updraft speeds. Results of a statistical analysis provide compelling evidence that the dynamical variability of vertical air motions on the mesoscale is the key factor determining the observed probability distributions of pristine ice crystal concentrations in cirrus. Other factors considered are changes of temperature as well as size, number, and ice nucleation thresholds of the freezing aerosol particles. The variability in vertical velocities is caused by atmospheric gravity waves leading to small-scale temperature fluctuations. Inasmuch as gravity waves are widespread, mesoscale variability in vertical velocities can be viewed as a universal feature of young cirrus clouds. Large-scale models that do not account for this subgrid-scale variability yield erroneous predictions of the variability of basic cirrus cloud properties. Climate change may bring about changes in the global distribution of updraft speeds, mean air temperatures, and aerosol properties. As shown in this work, these changes could significantly modify the probability distribution of cirrus ice crystal concentrations. This study emphasizes the key role of vertical velocities and mesoscale variability in vertical velocities in controlling cirrus properties. The results suggest that, in any effort to ascribe cause to trends of cirrus cloud properties, a careful evaluation of dynamical changes in cloud formation should be done before conclusions regarding the role of other anthropogenic factors, such as changes in aerosol composition, are made.},

This review assesses recent observational and modeling evidence of how anthropogenic activities might affect cirrus. Changes in physical properties and chemical composition of liquid aerosol particles will unlikely affect cirrus significantly, but anthropogenic influences may occur through changes in heterogeneous ice nuclei. Two main uncertain factors contribute to the current inability to constrain background cirrus formation: small-scale variability in dynamical forcings that drive ice nucleation parameterizations and the ability of airborne particles to act as efficient heterogeneous ice nuclei. These uncertainties keep us from drawing robust conclusions about anthropogenic influences on cirrus. Microphysical and macrophysical representation of cirrus in global models must first be advanced before we can predict changes in climate with fewer uncertainties. Some climate intervention studies suggest a potential cooling effect of deliberately perturbed cirrus, but at the risk of modifying precipitation inadvertently.},

The algorithm to retrieve LWP is based on simulated satellite observations. They are calculated with a radiative transfer model applied to about 3000 radiosonde ascents over the Atlantic Ocean. Since radiosonde observations do not contain direct information about cloud water and ice, these parameters are parameterized based on relative humidity and temperature using modified adiabatic liquid water density profiles. A multiple linear regression is applied to the simulated radiances and the calculated LWP to derive the algorithm. The retrieval accuracy based on the regression analysis including instrumental noise is 0.03 kg/m\textsuperscript{2}. Validation of the LWP-algorithm was pursued through a comparison with measurements of a ground-based 33 GHzmicrowave radiometer on board of R.V. "Poseidon" during the International Cirrus Experiment 1989 at the North Sea (ICE'89). The LWP values agree within the range of uncertainty caused by the different sampling characteristics of the observing systems. The retrieval accuracy for clear-sky cases determined using colocated METEOSAT data over the North Sea is 0.037 kg/m\textsuperscript{2} and confirms the accuracy estimated from regression analysis for the low liquid water cases. The algorithm was used to derive maps of monthly mean LWP over the Atlantic Ocean. As an example the Octobers of the 5 years 1987-1991 were selected to demonstrate the interannual variability of LWP. The results were compared with the cloud water content produced by the climate model ECHAM-T2 from the Max-Planck-Institut Hamburg. Observations during ICE'89 were used to check the accuracy of the applied radiative transfer model. Brightness temperatures were calculated from radiosonde ascents launched during the overpass of DMSP-F8 in cloud-free situations. The channel-dependent differences range from about -2 to 3 K. The possibility to identify different cloud types using microwave and infrared observations was examined. The main conclusion is that simultaneous microwave and infrared measurements enable the separation of dense cirrus and cirrus with underlying water clouds. A classification of clouds with respect to their top heights and LWP was carried out using a combination of SSM/I derived LWP and simultaneously recorded Meteosat IR-data during ICE'89.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, quantitative evaluation of such feedbacks is still insufficient. Here we provide quantitative evidence that heat input through the open water fraction is the primary driver of seasonal and interannual variations in Arctic sea ice retreat. Analyses of satellite data (1979?2014) and a simplified ice-upper ocean coupled model reveal that divergent ice motion in the early melt season triggers largescale feedback which subsequently amplifies summer sea ice anomalies. The magnitude of divergence controlling the feedback has doubled since 2000 due to a more mobile ice cover, which can partly explain the recent drastic ice reduction in the Arctic Ocean.},

Over the Western Arctic Ocean, total summertime cloud cover estimated from spaceborne radar and lidar data decreased by 16 \% from 2006 to 2007. The clearer skies led to downwelling shortwave (longwave) radiative fluxes increases of +32 Wm \dbend 2 (\dbend 4 Wm \dbend 2 ) from 2006 to 2007. Over three months, simple calculations show that these radiation differences alone could enhance surface ice melt by 0.3 m, or warm the surface ocean by 2.4 K, which enhances basal ice melt. Increased air temperatures and decreased relative humidity associated with an anticyclonic atmospheric circulation pattern explain the reduced cloudiness. Longer-term observations show that the 2007 cloudiness is anomalous in the recent past, but is not unprecedented. Thus, in a warmer world with thinner ice, natural summertime circulation and cloud variability is an increasingly important control on sea ice extent minima},

This study combines unique satellite observations with complementary data sets to document Arctic cloud and atmospheric structure during summer and early fall. The analysis focuses on 2006?2008, a period over which ice extent plummeted to record levels, substantial variability in atmospheric circulation patterns occurred, and spaceborne radar and lidar observations of vertical cloud structure became available. The observations show that large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, near-surface static stability, and surface conditions control Arctic cloud cover during the melt season. While no summer cloud response to sea ice loss was found, low clouds did form over newly open water during early fall. This seasonal variation in the cloud response to sea ice loss can be explained by near-surface static stability and air-sea temperature gradients. During summer, temperature inversions and weak air-sea temperature gradients limit atmosphere-ocean coupling. In contrast, relatively low static stability and strong air-sea gradients during early fall permit upward turbulent fluxes of moisture and heat and increased low cloud formation over newly open water. Because of their seasonal timing, cloud changes resulting from sea ice loss play a minor role in regulating ice-albedo feedbacks during summer, but may contribute to a cloud-ice feedback during early fall.},

While near-surface temperature and humidity are minimally affected by sea ice loss in July 2007 forecasts, near-surface stability decreases and atmospheric humidity increases aloft over newly open water in September 2007 forecasts. Ubiquitous low cloud increases over the newly ice-free Arctic Ocean are found in both the July 2007 and the September 2007 forecasts. In response to the 2007 sea ice loss, net surface [top of the atmosphere (TOA)] energy budgets change by 119.4 W m 22 (121.0 W m 22 ) and 217.9 W m 22 (11.4 W m 22 ) in the July 2007 and September 2007 forecasts, respectively. While many aspects of the forecasted response to sea ice loss are consistent with physical expectations and available observations, CAM4?s ubiquitous July 2007 cloud increases over newly open water are not. The unrealistic cloud response results from the global application of parameterization designed to diagnose stratus clouds based on lower-tropospheric stability (CLDST). In the Arctic, the well-mixed boundary layer assumption implicit in CLDST is violated. Requiring a well-mixed boundary layer to diagnose stratus clouds improves the CAM4 cloud response to sea ice loss and increases July 2007 surface (TOA) energy budgets over newly open water by 111 W m 22 (114.9 W m 22 ). Of importance to high-latitude climate feedbacks, unrealistic stratus cloud compensation for sea ice loss occurs only when stable and dry atmospheric conditions exist. Therefore, coupled climate projections that use CAM4 will underpredict Arctic sea ice loss only when dry and stable summer conditions occur.},

Physical parameter modi?cations reduce the Southern Ocean cloud phase and shortwave radiation biases in CAM5 and illustrate the power of the CALIPSO observations as an observational constraint.

Here CloudSat-based diagnostics for near-surface precipitation frequency are implemented in publicly available software that is widely used for climate model evaluation. The new diagnostics are ``definition aware'' and ``scale aware.'' As a result, the diagnostics enable robust assessment of modeled near-surface precipitation frequency at a range of intensity classes. The new diagnostics are used to evaluate precipitation frequency in a state-of-the-art climate model, the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1). CESM1 rains and snows too frequently, a bias that is especially pronounced for light rain. Conversely, while rare in both observations and CESM1, the heaviest rainfall events occur too infrequently in CESM1. Though the spatial distribution of snowfall events matches observations well, CESM1 also exhibits excessive snow frequency biases. Despite these biases, projected CESM1 changes in reflectivity-based diagnostics provide interesting insights into what a future 94-GHz radar could detect in a warmer world. With 3 \textdegree C of global warming, a future CloudSat-class mission would detect substantial conversion of snow to rain at midlatitudes, a narrowing of the Tropical Pacific rain belt, increased light rain in subtropics, and increased snow frequency in polar regions. The future CESM1 simulations also provide evidence that present-day spatial and magnitude biases imprint themselves on precipitation frequency changes. In summary, new precipitation frequency diagnostics for a range of precipitation intensities robustly expose climate model biases and inform expectations for observable future precipitation changes in a warming world.},

In this work, we extend the study to include pure water and an aqueous solution of analog sea salt drizzle droplets moving at terminal velocity with respect to the surrounding cold humid air. We observe an enhancement in the droplet shattering probability as compared to the stagnant air conditions used in the previous study. Under free-fall conditions, bubble bursts are the most common secondary ice production mode in sea salt drizzle droplets, while droplet fragmentation controls the secondary ice production in pure water droplets.}

  abstract = {A multispectral scanning spectrometer was used to obtain measurements of the bidirectional reflectance and brightness temperature of clouds, sea ice, snow, and tundra surfaces at 50 discrete wavelengths between 0.47 and 14.0 {$\mu$}m. These observations were obtained from the NASA ER-2 aircraft as part of the First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment (FIRE) Arctic Clouds Experiment, conducted over a 1600 km \texttimes{} 500 km region of the north slope of Alaska and surrounding Beaufort and Chukchi Seas between 18 May and 6 June 1998. Multispectral images in eight distinct bands of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Airborne Simulator (MAS) were used to derive a confidence in clear sky (or alternatively the probability of cloud) over five different ecosystems. Based on the results of individual tests run as part of this cloud mask, an algorithm was developed to estimate the phase of the clouds (liquid water, ice, or undetermined phase). Finally, the cloud optical thickness and effective radius were derived for both water and ice clouds that were detected during one flight line on 4 June. This analysis shows that the cloud mask developed for operational use on MODIS, and tested using MAS data in Alaska, is quite capable of distinguishing clouds from bright sea ice surfaces during daytime conditions in the high Arctic. Results of individual tests, however, make it difficult to distinguish ice clouds over snow and sea ice surfaces, so additional tests were added to enhance the confidence in the thermodynamic phase of clouds over the Chukchi Sea. The cloud optical thickness and effective radius retrievals used three distinct bands of the MAS, with a recently developed 1.62- and 2.13-{$\mu$}m-band algorithm being used quite successfully over snow and sea ice surfaces. These results are contrasted with a MODIS-based algorithm that relies on spectral reflectance at 0.87 and 2.13 {$\mu$}m.},

  abstract = {Recently published studies of triple-frequency radar observations of snowfall have demonstrated that naturally occurring snowflakes exhibit scattering signatures that are in some cases consistent with spheroidal particle models and in others can only be explained by complex aggregates. Until recently, no in situ observations have been available to investigate links between microphysical snowfall properties and their scattering properties. In this study, we investigate for the first time relations between collocated ground-based triple-frequency observations with in situ measurements of snowfall at the ground. The three analyzed snowfall cases obtained during a recent field campaign in Finland cover light to moderate snowfall rates with transitions from heavily rimed snow to open-structured, low-density snowflakes. The observed triple-frequency signatures agree well with the previously published findings from airborne radar observations. A rich spatiotemporal structure of triple-frequency observations throughout the cloud is observed during the three cases, which often seems to be related to riming and aggregation zones within the cloud. The comparison of triple-frequency signatures from the lowest altitudes with the ground-based in situ measurements reveals that in the presence of large ({$>$}5 mm) snow aggregates, a bending away in the triple-frequency space from the curve of classical spheroid scattering models is always observed. Rimed particles appear along an almost horizontal line in the triple-frequency space, which was not observed before. Overall, the three case studies indicate a close connection of triple-frequency signatures and snow particle structure, bulk snowfall density, and characteristic size of the particle size distribution.},

Due to the third frequency, a characteristic curve can be derived which is almost independent of the underlying particle size distribution and velocity-size relation. This approach provides new opportunities for validating existing and future snow scattering models and reveals how the information content of triple-frequency radar data sets can be further exploited for snowfall studies.},

  abstract = {The International Summer Snowfall Workshop (ISSW) is a new workshop format for the international scientific community working on ground- and space-based observations, retrievals, and radiative transfer related to snowfall. This new snowfall workshop was inspired by the successful series of International Workshops on Space-based Snowfall Measurements (IWSSM; Bennartz et al. 2011), the latest of which (IWSSM-5) was held concurrently with the International Precipitation Working Group (IPWG) meeting in Bologna, Italy, in 2016. The new biennial ISSW is not intended to replace the IWSSM but rather to provide a forum to discuss specific urgent research topics related to snowfall that have been identified at larger meetings. The first ISSW was held at the University of Cologne, in Cologne, Germany during June 2017. The workshop was attended by about 50 scientists from various universities, research institutions, and weather services in the United States and Europe. The focus topic of this first workshop was the characterization of scattering properties of ice and snow particles at the recommendation of the last joint IWSSM?IPWG meeting in Bologna. Almost 10 years ago, Liu (2008) presented in a BAMS article a freely available scattering database of realistically shaped ice particles; this database is still one of the most-used sources for scattering properties in the microwave region. Since then, not only has the number of datasets and particle habits grown greatly, thanks to increasingly available high-performance computing infrastructure and advances in modeling snowflake formation processes at the single-particle level, but so has their complexity (Fig. 1). There is a broad consensus in the remote sensing community that it is necessary to bring users and developers of scattering databases together to agree on standards and conventions on how to store the complex scattering datasets in a generalized format and according to well-defined quality standards. In addition to a discussion of the progress and current state of scattering computations, the workshop program also addressed topics such as how to better link in situ observations to the particle models used for scattering computations, how to achieve a close interaction between the users and developers of the databases, and how observational constraints can be developed to validate the scattering datasets.},

  abstract = {Riming is an efficient process of converting liquid cloud water into ice and plays an important role in the formation of precipitation in cold clouds. Due to the rapid increase in ice particle mass, riming enhances the particle's terminal velocity, which can be detected by ground-based vertically pointing cloud radars if the effect of vertical air motions can be sufficiently mitigated. In our study, we first revisit a previously published approach to relate the radar mean Doppler velocity (MDV) to rime mass fraction (FR) using a large ground-based in situ dataset. This relation is then applied to multiyear datasets of cloud radar observations collected at four European sites covering polluted central European, clean maritime, and Arctic climatic conditions. We find that riming occurs in 1\%\textendash 8\% of the nonconvective ice containing clouds with median FR between 0.5 and 0.6. Both the frequency of riming and FR reveal relatively small variations for different seasons. In contrast to previous studies, which suggested enhanced riming for clean environments, our statistics indicate the opposite; however, the differences between the locations are overall small. We find a very strong relation between the frequency of riming and temperature. While riming is rare at temperatures lower than -12\textdegree C, it strongly increases toward 0\textdegree C. Previous studies found a very similar temperature dependence for the amount and droplet size of supercooled liquid water, which might be closely connected to the riming signature found in this study. In contrast to riming frequency, we find almost no temperature dependence for FR.},

The drop size distribution is then retrieved from the shifted Doppler spectrum. An example of the structure of two-dimensional updrafts and downdrafts observed in the low levels of a convective storm is presented. Drop size distributions can also be estimated and evidence of small drop removal by the updraft is presented.},

  abstract = {Observations from a 94-GHz radar are used to define the vertical structure of marine fair-weather cumuli. Doppler spectra obtained from the radar provide mean vertical velocities as well as detailed spectral shapes that can be used to infer small-scale vertical velocity shear, illuminate cloud microphysical processes, and provide estimates of turbulence dissipation rates. These new observations facilitate the analysis and understanding of in-cloud circulations and the physical processes involved, since the cloud boundaries and dimensions are mapped along with the internal structure of the clouds. Coincident observations from a 915-MHz radar (wind profiler) were used to further define the turbulence structure in and around the clouds. The observations document the detailed vertical and horizontal dimensions of updraft and downdraft circulations in the clouds observed. The two cumuli studied in detail have similar circulation patterns\textemdash an updraft core surrounded by downdrafts. Although the clouds have a horizontal depth of only about 700 m, updraft velocities of about 5.5 m s-1 were observed. These updrafts, which are only about 400 m across, exhibit characteristics that are consistent with adiabatic ascent, and penetrate about 150 m into the capping inversion. No penetrating downdrafts are observed within the updraft cores. The downdrafts that flank the updraft on the downwind side of the cloud are relatively narrow (less than 100 m) and extend from cloud top to cloud base. The downdraft on the upwind side of the cloud is about 150 m across and penetrates about 200 m into the detraining cloud mass observed in this part of the cloud. This downdraft appears to be driven by the cooling associated with entrainment mixing at cloud top penetrating through detraining, dynamically inactive parts of the cloud matter. Analysis of the Doppler spectrum at the updraft\textendash downdraft interfaces indicates large Doppler spectral widths due to turbulence and sharp shear zones in the radar sampling volume. Large Doppler spectral widths in the detraining upwind part of the cloud are consistent with the presence of larger droplets. The updraft core structure in one of the clouds has a structure that is consistent with the idea that cumulus clouds are composed of successive bubbles that emerge from the subcloud layer. Thus these small cumuli should be considered as convective complexes rather than simple growing elements that later decay into passive clouds. This study illustrates the potential of millimeter-wavelength radars for studying small cumuli.},

The data provide strong evidence of the interaction between draft intensity and raindrop size distribution and highlight the variability of convective precipitation at small scales. Horizontal sorting of the raindrops caused by the air motion is documented. Signal attenuation measured at 94 GHz is shown to be well correlated to rainfall rates.

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program operates millimeter-wavelength cloud radars in several climatologically distinct regions. The digital signal processors for these radars were recently upgraded and allow for enhancements in the operational parameters running on them. Recent evaluations of millimeter-wavelength cloud radar signal processing performance relative to the range of cloud dynamical and microphysical conditions encountered at the ARM Program sites have indicated that improvements are necessary, including significant improvement in temporal resolution (i.e., less than 1 s for dwell and 2 s for dwell and processing), wider Nyquist velocities, operational dealiasing of the recorded spectra, removal of pulse compression while sampling the boundary layer, and continuous recording of Doppler spectra. A new set of millimeter-wavelength cloud radar operational modes that incorporate these enhancements is presented. A significant change in radar sampling is the introduction of an uneven mode sequence with 50\% of the sampling time dedicated to the lower atmosphere, allowing for detailed characterization of boundary layer clouds. The changes in the operational modes have a substantial impact on the postprocessing algorithms that are used to extract cloud information from the radar data. New methods for postprocessing of recorded Doppler spectra are presented that result in more accurate identification of radar clutter (e.g., insects) and extraction of turbulence and microphysical information. Results of recent studies on the error characteristics of derived Doppler moments are included so that uncertainty estimates are now included with the moments. The microscale data product based on the increased temporal resolution of the millimeter-wavelength cloud radars is described. It contains the number of local maxima in each Doppler spectrum, the Doppler moments of the primary peak, uncertainty estimates for the Doppler moments of the primary peak, Doppler moment shape parameters (e.g., skewness and kurtosis), and clear-air clutter flags.},

Here, the first generation of sampling strategies for the scanning ARM cloud radars (SACRs) is presented. These scan strategies are designed to address the scientific objectives of ARM; however, they introduce an initial framework for operational scanning cloud radars. While the weather community uses scan strategies that are based on a sequence of scans at constant elevations, the SACR scan strategies are based on a sequence of scans at constant azimuth. This is attributed to the cloud geometrical properties, which are vastly different from the rain and snow shafts that are the primary targets of precipitation radars; the need to cover the cone of silence; and the scanning limitations of the SACRs. A ``cloud surveillance'' scan strategy is introduced that is based on a sequence of horizon-to-horizon range\textendash height indicator (RHI) scans that sample the hemispherical sky (HS) every 30\textdegree{} azimuth (HSRHI). The HSRHI scan strategy is complimented with a low-elevation plan position indicator (PPI) scan. The HSRHI and PPI are repeated every 30 min to provide a static view of the cloud conditions around the SACR location. Between the HSRHI and PPI scan strategies, other scan strategies are introduced depending on the cloud conditions. In the future, information about the atmospheric cloud state will be used in a closed-loop process to optimize the selection of the SACR scan strategy.},

In this study, the phase partitioning of cloud water is compared among six global climate models (GCMs) and with Cloud and Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization retrievals. It is found that the GCMs predict vastly different distributions of cloud phase for a given temperature, and none of them are capable of reproducing the spatial distribution or magnitude of the observed phase partitioning. While some GCMs produced liquid water paths comparable to satellite observations, they all failed to preserve sufficient liquid water at mixed-phase cloud temperatures. Our results suggest that validating GCMs using only the vertically integrated water contents could lead to amplified differences in cloud radiative feedback. The sensitivity of the simulated cloud phase in GCMs to the choice of heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization is also investigated. The response to a change in ice nucleation is quite different for each GCM, and the implementation of the same ice nucleation parameterization in all models does not reduce the spread in simulated phase among GCMs. The results suggest that processes subsequent to ice nucleation are at least as important in determining phase and should be the focus of future studies aimed at understanding and reducing differences among the models.},

  abstract = {The most accurate value of total solar irradiance during the 2008 solar minimum period is 1360.8 {$\pm$} 0.5 W m-2 according to measurements from the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM) on NASA's Solar Radiation and Climate Experiment (SORCE) and a series of new radiometric laboratory tests. This value is significantly lower than the canonical value of 1365.4 {$\pm$} 1.3 W m-2 established in the 1990s, which energy balance calculations and climate models currently use. Scattered light is a primary cause of the higher irradiance values measured by the earlier generation of solar radiometers in which the precision aperture defining the measured solar beam is located behind a larger, view-limiting aperture. In the TIM, the opposite order of these apertures precludes this spurious signal by limiting the light entering the instrument. We assess the accuracy and stability of irradiance measurements made since 1978 and the implications of instrument uncertainties and instabilities for climate research in comparison with the new TIM data. TIM's lower solar irradiance value is not a change in the Sun's output, whose variations it detects with stability comparable or superior to prior measurements; instead, its significance is in advancing the capability of monitoring solar irradiance variations on climate-relevant time scales and in improving estimates of Earth energy balance, which the Sun initiates.},

  abstract = {Ice crystals in atmospheric clouds have shapes, which affect their density, terminal fall velocity, growth rate and radiative properties. In calculations for climate change predictions, weather forecasting of precipitation, and remote sensing retrievals, idealized crystal shapes such as columns, needles, plates and dendrites are assumed. Using new technology imaging instrumentation with a resolution of 2.3 gm, recent observations in Arctic clouds have shown that such pristine habits only describe approximately 3\% of the particles. The measurements were made from an aircraft during April 1998 and cover a temperature range of 0 \textdegree C to -45 \textdegree C. Boundary layer, multi-layer and cirrus clouds were examined. The commonly observed irregularly shaped particles either consisted of faceted polycrystalline particles or sublimating (solid to vapor) ice particles with smooth curving sides and edges. Since climate warming is now predicted to be largest in the Arctic, and cloud properties significantly affect the radiation balance, it will be necessary to consider the effects of non-pristine ice particle habits in such calculations and prediction},

Future improvement of the accuracy of weather prediction and climate models relies on a proper description of SIP in numerical simulations. For now, laboratory studies remain a primary tool for developing physically based parameterizations for cloud modeling. Over the past 7 decades, six different SIP-identifying mechanisms have emerged: (1) shattering during droplet freezing, (2) the rime-splintering (Hallett\textendash Mossop) process, (3) fragmentation due to ice\textendash ice collision, (4) ice particle fragmentation due to thermal shock, (5) fragmentation of sublimating ice, and (6) activation of ice-nucleating particles in transient supersaturation around freezing drops. This work presents a critical review of the laboratory studies related to secondary ice production. While some of the six mechanisms have received little research attention, for others contradictory results have been obtained by different research groups. Unfortunately, despite vast investigative efforts, the lack of consistency and the gaps in the accumulated knowledge hinder the development of quantitative descriptions of any of the six SIP mechanisms. The present work aims to identify gaps in our knowledge of SIP as well as to stimulate further laboratory studies focused on obtaining a quantitative description of efficiencies for each SIP mechanism.},

  abstract = {Tropospheric clouds are a very important component of the climate system and the hydrological cycle in the Arctic and sub-Arctic. Liquid water path (LWP) is one of the key parameters of clouds urgently needed for a variety of studies, including the snow cover and climate modelling at northern latitudes. A joint analysis was made of the LWP values obtained from observations by the SEVIRI satellite instrument and from ground-based observations by the RPGHATPRO microwave radiometer near St Petersburg, Russia (60 ? N, 30 ? E). The time period of selected data sets spans 2 years (December 2012?November 2014) excluding winter months, since the speci?c requirements for SEVIRI observations restrict measurements at northern latitudes in winter when the solar zenith angle is too large. The radiometer measurement site is located very close to the shore of the Gulf of Finland, and our study has revealed considerable differences between the LWP values obtained by SEVIRI over land and over water areas in the region under investigation. Therefore, special attention was paid to the analysis of the LWP spatial distributions derived from SEVIRI observations at scales from 15 to 150 km in the vicinity of St Petersburg. Good agreement between the daily median LWP values obtained from the SEVIRI and the RPG-HATPRO observations was shown: the rms difference was estimated at 0.016 kg m ?2 for a warm season and 0.048 kg m ?2 for a cold season. Over 7 months (February?May and August?October), the SEVIRI and the RPG-HATPRO instruments revealed similar diurnal variations in LWP, while considerable discrepancies between the diurnal variations obtained by the two instruments were detected in June and July. On the basis of reanalysis data, it was shown that the LWP diurnal cycles are characterised by considerable interannual variability.},

  abstract = {The microphysical and radiative properties of cirrus clouds continue to be beyond understanding and thus still represent one of the largest uncertainties in the prediction of the Earth's climate (IPCC, 2013). Our study aims to provide a guide to cirrus microphysics, which is compiled from an extensive set of model simulations, covering the broad range of atmospheric conditions for cirrus formation and evolution. The model results are portrayed in the same parameter space as field measurements, i.e., in the Ice Water Content-Temperature (IWC-T) parameter space. We validate this cirrus analysis approach by evaluating cirrus data sets from 17 aircraft campaigns, conducted in the last 15 years, spending about 94 h in cirrus over Europe, Australia, Brazil as well as South and North America. Altogether, the approach of this study is to track cirrus IWC development with temperature by means of model simulations, compare with observations and then assign, to a certain degree, cirrus microphysics to the observations. Indeed, the field observations show characteristics expected from the simulated Cirrus Guide. For example, high (low) IWCs are found together with high (low) ice crystal concentrations Nice. An important finding from our study is the classification of two types of cirrus with differing formation mechanisms and microphysical properties: the first cirrus type forms directly as ice (in situ origin cirrus) and splits in two subclasses, depending on the prevailing strength of the updraft: in slow updrafts these cirrus are rather thin with lower IWCs, while in fast updrafts thicker cirrus with higher IWCs can form. The second type consists predominantly of thick cirrus originating from mixed phase clouds (i.e., via freezing of liquid droplets \textendash{} liquid origin cirrus), which are completely glaciated while lifting to the cirrus formation temperature region ({$<$} 235 K). In the European field campaigns, slow updraft in situ origin cirrus occur frequently in low- and high-pressure systems, while fast updraft in situ cirrus appear in conjunction with jet streams or gravity waves. Also, liquid origin cirrus mostly related to warm conveyor belts are found. In the US and tropical campaigns, thick liquid origin cirrus which are formed in large convective systems are detected more frequently.},

  abstract = {This study presents airborne in situ and satellite remote sensing climatologies of cirrus clouds and humidity. The climatologies serve as a guide to the properties of cirrus clouds, with the new in situ database providing detailed insights into boreal midlatitudes and the tropics, while the satellite-borne data set offers a global overview. To this end, an extensive, quality-checked data archive, the Cirrus Guide II in situ database, is created from airborne in situ measurements during 150 flights in 24 campaigns. The archive contains meteorological parameters, ice water content (IWC), ice crystal number concentration (Nice), ice crystal mean mass radius (Rice), relative humidity with respect to ice (RHice), and water vapor mixing ratio (H2O) for each of the flights. Depending on the parameter, the database has been extended by about a factor of 5\textendash 10 compared to earlier studies. As one result of our investigation, we show that the medians of Nice, Rice, and RHice have distinct patterns in the IWC\textendash T parameter space. Lookup tables of these variables as functions of IWC and T can be used to improve global model cirrus representation and remote sensing retrieval methods. Another outcome of our investigation is that across all latitudes, the thicker liquid-origin cirrus predominate at lower altitudes, while at higher altitudes the thinner in situ-origin cirrus prevail. Further, examination of the radiative characteristics of in situ-origin and liquid-origin cirrus shows that the in situ-origin cirrus only slightly warm the atmosphere, while liquid-origin cirrus have a strong cooling effect. An important step in completing the Cirrus Guide II is the provision of the global cirrus Nice climatology, derived by means of the retrieval algorithm DARDAR-Nice from 10 years of cirrus remote sensing observations from satellite. The in situ measurement database has been used to evaluate and improve the satellite observations. We found that the global median Nice from satellite observations is almost 2 times higher than the in situ median and increases slightly with decreasing temperature. Nice medians of the most frequently occurring cirrus sorted by geographical regions are highest in the tropics, followed by austral and boreal midlatitudes, Antarctica, and the Arctic. Since the satellite climatologies enclose the entire spatial and temporal Nice occurrence, we could deduce that half of the cirrus are located in the lowest, warmest (224\textendash 242 K) cirrus layer and contain a significant amount of liquid-origin cirrus. A specific highlight of the study is the in situ observations of cirrus and humidity in the Asian monsoon anticyclone and the comparison to the surrounding tropics. In the convectively very active Asian monsoon, peak values of Nice and IWC of 30 cm-3 and 1000 ppmv are detected around the cold point tropopause (CPT). Above the CPT, ice particles that are convectively injected can locally add a significant amount of water available for exchange with the stratosphere. We found IWCs of up to 8 ppmv in the Asian monsoon in comparison to only 2 ppmv in the surrounding tropics. Also, the highest RHice values (120 \%\textendash 150 \%) inside of clouds and in clear sky are observed around and above the CPT. We attribute this to the high H2O mixing ratios (typically 3\textendash 5 ppmv) observed in the Asian monsoon compared to 1.5 to 3 ppmv found in the tropics. Above the CPT, supersaturations of 10 \%\textendash 20 \% are observed in regions of weak convective activity and up to about 50 \% in the Asian monsoon. This implies that the water available for transport into the stratosphere might be higher than the expected saturation value.},

It is therefore important that climate models simulate basic cloud properties like cloud cover and cloud phase correctly. We compare results from the global atmospheric model ECHAM6 to observations from the CALIPSO satellite active lidar instrument using the COSP satellite simulator. Our results show that the model is able to reproduce the spatial distribution and cloud amount in the Arctic to some extent, but that cloud cover has a positive bias (caused by an overestimation of low-level, liquid containing cloud) in regions where the surface is covered by snow or ice. We explored the sensitivity of cloud cover to the strength of surface heat fuxes, but only by increasing surface mixing the observed cloud cover bias cloud be reduced. As ECHAM6 already mixes too strongly in the Arctic, the cloud cover bias can mainly be attributed to cloud microphysical processes. Improvements in the phase partitioning of Arctic low-level clouds could be achieved by a more effective Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process but total cloud cover remained still overestimated. By allowing for a slight supersaturation with respect to ice within the cloud cover scheme, we were able to also reduce this positive cloud cover bias.},

On particular flights, HALO performed measurements closely collocated with overpasses of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aboard the Aqua satellite. A cirrus cloud located above liquid water clouds and a DCC topped by an anvil cirrus are analyzed in this paper. Based on the nadir spectral upward radiance measured above the two clouds, the optical thickness {$\tau$} and particle effective radius reff of the cirrus and DCC are retrieved using a radiance ratio technique, which considers the cloud thermodynamic phase, the vertical profile of cloud microphysical properties, the presence of multilayer clouds, and the heterogeneity of the surface albedo. For the cirrus case, the comparison of {$\tau$} and reff retrieved on the basis of SMART and MODIS measurements yields a normalized mean absolute deviation of up to 1.2 \% for {$\tau$} and 2.1 \% for reff. For the DCC case, deviations of up to 3.6 \% for {$\tau$} and 6.2 \% for reff are obtained. The larger deviations in the DCC case are mainly attributed to the fast cloud evolution and three-dimensional (3-D) radiative effects. Measurements of spectral upward radiance at near-infrared wavelengths are employed to investigate the vertical profile of reff in the cirrus. The retrieved values of reff are compared with corresponding in situ measurements using a vertical weighting method. Compared to the MODIS observations, measurements of SMART provide more information on the vertical distribution of particle sizes, which allow reconstructing the profile of reff close to the cloud top. The comparison between retrieved and in situ reff yields a normalized mean absolute deviation, which ranges between 1.5 and 10.3 \%, and a robust correlation coefficient of 0.82.},

The calibrations of the radar receiver and the radiometric receiver are performed via a two-point calibration with liquid nitrogen. The passive channel at 89 GHz is particularly useful for deriving an estimate of the liquid water path (LWP). The developed retrieval shows that the LWP can be retrieved with an RMS uncertainty (not including potential calibration offsets) of about 615 g m22 when constraining the integrated water vapor from an external source with an uncertainty of 62 kg m22. Finally, a dealiasing method [dual-radar dealiasing method (DRDM)] for FMCW Doppler spectra is introduced that combines measurements of two collocated radars with different measurement setups. The DRDM ensures high range resolution with a wide unambiguous Doppler velocity range.},

  abstract = {In order to study aerosol\textendash cloud interactions in cirrus clouds, we apply a new multiple-mode ice microphysical scheme to the general circulation model ECHAM5-HAM. The multiple-mode ice microphysical scheme allows for analysis of the competition between homogeneous freezing of solution droplets, deposition nucleation of pure dust particles, and immersion freezing of coated dust particles and pre-existing ice. We base the freezing efficiencies of coated and pure dust particles on the most recent laboratory data. The effect of pre-existing ice, which has been neglected in previous ice nucleation parameterizations, is to deplete water vapour by depositional growth and thus prevent homogeneous and heterogeneous freezing from occurring. As a first step, we extensively tested the model and validated the results against in situ measurements from various aircraft campaigns. The results compare well with observations; properties such as ice crystal size and number concentration as well as supersaturation are predicted within the observational spread. We find that heterogeneous nucleation on mineral dust particles and the consideration of pre-existing ice in the nucleation process may lead to significant effects: globally, ice crystal number and mass are reduced by 10 and 5\%, whereas the ice crystals' size is increased by 3\%. The reductions in ice crystal number are most pronounced in the tropics and mid-latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere. While changes in the microphysical and radiative properties of cirrus clouds in the tropics are mostly driven by considering pre-existing ice, changes in the northern hemispheric mid-latitudes mainly result from heterogeneous nucleation. The so-called negative Twomey effect in cirrus clouds is represented in ECHAM5-HAM. The net change in the radiation budget is -0.94 W m-2, implying that both heterogeneous nucleation on dust and pre-existing ice have the potential to modulate cirrus properties in climate simulations and thus should be considered in future studies.},

In some cases, these generating cells are enshrouded by enhanced differential reflectivity ZDR, indicating a ``shroud'' of pristine crystals enveloping the larger, more isotropic particles. The anticorrelation of radar reflectivity factor at horizontal polarization ZH and ZDR suggests ongoing aggregation or riming of particles in the core of generating cells. For cases in which radiosonde data were collected, potential instability was found within the layer in which generating cells were observed. The persistence of these layers suggests that radiative effects are important, perhaps by some combination of cloud-top cooling and release of latent enthalpy through depositional and riming growth of particles within the cloud. The implications for the ubiquity of generating cells and their role as a mechanism for ice crystal initiation and growth are discussed.},

In particular, there has been recent focus on improving representations of ice collection processes (e.g., aggregation and riming), as these influence precipitation rate, heating profiles, and ultimately cloud life cycles. However, distinguishing these processes using conventional polarimetric radar observations is difficult, as they produce similar fingerprints. This necessitates improved analysis techniques and integration of complementary data sources. The Midlatitude Continental Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) provided such an opportunity. Quasi?vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables in two MC3E stratiform precipitation events reveal episodic melting layer sagging. Integrated analyses using scanning and vertically pointing radar and aircraft measurements reveal that saggy bright band signatures are produced when denser, faster?falling, more isometric hydrometeors (relative to adjacent times) descend into the melting layer. In one case, strong circumstantial evidence for riming is found during bright band sagging times. A bin microphysical melting layer model successfully reproduces many aspects of the signature, supporting the observational analysis. If found to be a reliable indicator of riming, saggy bright bands could be a proxy for the presence of supercooled liquid water in stratiform precipitation, which may provide important information for mitigating aircraft icing risks and for constraining microphysical models.},

In this study, the quasi-vertical profile (QVP) technique (wherein data from a given elevation angle scan are azimuthally averaged and the range coordinate is converted to height) is extended and applied to polarimetric WSR-88D observations of six Northeast winter storms to survey their evolving, bulk vertical microphysical and kinematic structures. These analyses are supplemented using hourly analyses from the Rapid Refresh (RAP) model. Regions of ascent inferred from QVPs were consistently associated with notable polarimetric signatures, implying planar crystal growth when near -15\textdegree C, and riming and secondary ice production at higher temperatures. The heaviest snowfall occurred most often when ascent and enhanced propagation differential phase shift () occurred near -15\textdegree C. When available, limited surface observations confirmed heavy snowfall rates and revealed large snow-to-liquid ratios at these times. Other cases revealed sudden, large melting-layer excursions associated with precipitation-type transitions near the surface. RAP analyses failed to capture such complex evolution, demonstrating the added value of dual-polarization radar observations in these scenarios and the potential use of radar data for assessing model performance in real time. These insights are a preliminary step toward better understanding the complex processes in northeastern U.S. winter storms.}

Daily radar derived cloud fraction profiles peak at different height levels depending on the depth of the cumuli and thus the extent to which they precipitate. Nonprecipitating cumuli have a peak cloud fraction of about 5\% near mean cloud base (700 m), whereas precipitating cumuli tend to have a peak of only 2\% near cloud base. Nineteen percent of the precipitating cumuli are accompanied by large cloud fractions near the detrainment level of cumulus tops ( 1700 m). Day-to-day variations in cloud fraction near cloud base are modest ( 3\%). Nonprecipitating cumuli have their largest reflectivities near cloud top and an ascending core surrounded by a subsiding shell. Precipitating cumuli with enhanced elevated cloudiness (stratiform outflow) are deeper and contain larger vertical gradients in reflectivity and Doppler velocity than precipitating cumuli without such outflow. Bulk (3 h) statistics reveal that nonprecipitating shallow cumuli are active and organized. They contain on average 79\% in-cloud updrafts with 86\% of them being organized in large coherent structures contributing to a maximum updraft mass flux of 8\textendash 36 gm\^2 s\^-1 just above cloud base. Alternatively, downdrafts contribute insignificantly to the mass flux and show little vertical and temporal variability (0\textendash 7 gm\^2 s\^-1).

Secondary-ice production is thought to be responsible for the observed discrepancies between the ice crystal number concentration and the ice-nucleating particle concentration in clouds. The Hallett\textendash Mossop process is active between -3 and -8 \textdegree C and has been implemented into several models, while all other secondary-ice processes are poorly constrained and lack a well-founded quantification. During 2 h of measurements taken on a mountain slope just above the melting layer at temperatures warmer than -3 \textdegree C, a continuously high concentration of small plates identified as secondary ice was observed. The presence of drizzle drops suggests droplet fragmentation upon freezing as the responsible secondary-ice mechanism. The constant supply of drizzle drops can be explained by a recirculation theory, suggesting that melted snowflakes, which sedimented through the melting layer, were reintroduced into the cloud as drizzle drops by orographically forced updrafts. Here we introduce a parametrization of droplet fragmentation at slightly sub-zero temperatures, where primary-ice nucleation is basically absent, and the first ice is initiated by the collision of drizzle drops with aged ice crystals sedimenting from higher altitudes. Based on previous measurements, we estimate that a droplet of 200 \textmu m in diameter produces 18 secondary-ice crystals when it fragments upon freezing. The application of the parametrization to our measurements suggests that the actual number of splinters produced by a fragmenting droplet may be up to an order of magnitude higher.},

There is a distinctive difference in cirrus ice particle shapes formed in situ compared to those in anvils that are generated in close proximity to convection. More than half the mass in cirrus formed in situ are rosette shapes (polycrystals and bullet rosettes). Cirrus formed from fresh convective anvils is mostly devoid of rosette-shaped particles. However, small frozen drops may experience regrowth downwind of an aged anvil in a regime with RHice {$>$} 120\% and then grow into rosette shapes. Identifiable particle shapes in tropical maritime anvils that have not been impacted by continental influences typically contain mostly single plate-like and columnar crystals and aggregates. Midlatitude continental anvils contain single-rimed particles, more and larger aggregates with riming, and chains of small ice particles when in a highly electrified environment.

To investigate the ability of multifrequency radars to detect riming, a three-dimensional model of snowflake growth was used to generate simulated aggregate and crystal snowflakes with various degrees of riming. Three different growth scenarios, representing different temporal relationships between aggregation and riming, were formulated. The discrete dipole approximation was then used to compute the radar backscattering properties of the snowflakes at frequencies of 9.7, 13.6, 35.6, and 94 GHz. In two of the three growth scenarios, the rimed snowflakes exhibit large differences between the backscattering cross sections of the detailed three-dimensional models and the equivalent homogeneous spheroidal models, similarly to earlier results for unrimed snowflakes. When three frequencies are used simultaneously, riming appears to be detectable in a robust manner across all three scenarios. In spite of the differences in backscattering cross sections, the triple-frequency signatures of heavily rimed particles resemble those of the homogeneous spheroids, thus explaining earlier observational results that were compatible with such spheroids.},

This conceptual model is at the core of the current ice microphysical schemes and used for dual-polarization radar observation based classification of hydrometeors. A quantitative relation between riming and shapes of snowflake aggregates, however, has not been established yet. This study aims to derive this relation by using surface-based precipitation and coinciding dual-polarization radar observations. The observations were collected during four winter seasons, 49 snowstorms, at University of Helsinki measurement station in Hyyti\"al\"a, Finland. Results show that relation between the differential reflectivity and reflectivity-weighted rime mass fraction is not monotonic and depends on reflectivity-weighted mean diameter. This behavior can be explained by the opposing effects of riming on dual-polarization radar observations. Riming increases particle bulk density, which leads to more pronounced dual-polarization radar signatures. As riming progresses the aspect ratio of snowflake increases slowly until the rime mass fraction value reaches a certainty value after which the aspect ratio increases more rapidly. Finally, coutilization of Ze, Zdr, and Kdp for inferring riming fraction is analyzed.},

Recent work suggests that less (more) low-level cloud occurrence is found in higher (lower) lead fraction periods, yet the analysis efforts were limited to a peripheral sea north of Barrow, Alaska. Here, we extend the previous study to examine this relationship between wintertime Arctic leads and low clouds in the context of a longer time series (November\textendash March, 2006\textendash 2011) and greater spatial coverage (pan-Arctic), based on cloud products from CloudSat and Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellites and lead area fraction derived from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) observations. We focus on the east side of high-pressure systems to isolate lead impacts on boundary layer clouds. Using a k-means cluster-analysis algorithm, low-level cloud regimes are categorized on the basis of occurrence frequency of low-level clouds. We find that, in the pan-Arctic, less (more) low-level cloud occurrence is associated with higher (lower) large-scale lead flux, in agreement with the previous study. This lead-low cloud association exhibits strong regional variation; it is enhanced over the Beaufort Sea where the variability of large-scale meteorological conditions is decreased. These results suggest that a higher lead fraction might have important impacts on the Arctic surface energy budget by decreasing downwelling longwave radiation through reduced low-level cloudiness.},

The observed phenomenon occurs as a two-layer linear depolarization ratio (LDR) signature in a single radar bright band. Doppler spectra observations show that the upper LDR layer is caused by the melting of ice needles, potentially generated by the rime-splintering process, while the lower one is mainly due to the melting of background ice particles formed at the cloud top. The melting signal of small needles acts as a unique benchmark for detecting the onset of melting and is used to verify the current methods for the identification of melting layer boundaries. The radar-derived characteristics of the melting layer are found to be dependent on the radar variable and frequency used. The implications of the presented findings for radar-based studies of precipitation properties in and above the melting layer are also discussed.},

The cloud fraction is divided into the supercooled liquid water (SLW)-containing clouds and the all-ice clouds. The low-level SLW fraction varies according to temperature and sea ice fraction. It is the largest over water. In East Antarctica, the SLW fraction decreases sharply polewards. It is two to three times higher in West Antarctica. The all-ice cloud geographical distribution is shaped by the interaction of the main low-pressure systems surrounding the continent and the orography, with little links with sea ice fraction. We demonstrate the largest impact of sea ice on SLW (mostly mixed-phase clouds, MPC) in autumn and winter, while it is almost null in summer and intermediate in spring. Monthly variability of MPC shows a maximum fraction at the end of summer and minimum in winter. Conversely, the unglaciated (pure) SLW (USLW) fraction has a maximum at the beginning of summer. Monthly evolutions of MPC and USLW fractions do not differ on the continent. This demonstrates a seasonality in the glaciation process in marine liquid-bearing clouds. From the literature, we identify the pattern of the monthly evolution of the MPC fraction as being similar to the one of the aerosols, which is related to marine biological activity. Marine bioaerosols are known to be ef?cient Ice Nucleating Particles (INPs). The emission of these INPs into the atmosphere from open waters would come on top of the temperature and sea ice fraction seasonalities as factors explaining the mixed-phase clouds monthly evolution.},

  abstract = {The Arctic is a very pristine and vulnerable region. In this region, climate change is dramatically apparent by larger temperature changes than in mid-latitudes. Furthermore, aerosol sources are rare in the Arctic resulting in low cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations. The Arctic surface is ice covered most of the time, but changes of the surface occur in the transition seasons spring and autumn. This leads to interactions with Arctic mixed-phase clouds. They are low-level clouds and regularly observed in these high latitudes. Moreover, they consist of supercooled droplets and ice particles at the same time. Depending on the surface type, Arctic mixed-phase clouds impact the surface radiative heating or cooling and the turbulent heating. Furthermore, they influence the boundary layer (BL) structure. Arctic mixed-phase clouds are influenced by changes in atmospheric conditions and are important for the surface energy balance. Processes that affect the life cycle of Arctic mixed-phase clouds are relatively poorly understood. Thus, field campaigns help to understand Arctic mixed-phase clouds and provide data for model studies to investigate microphysical and macrophysical processes related to the life cycle of Arctic mixed-phase clouds mechanistically. This thesis provides new insights into macro- and microphysical properties of Arctic mixed-phase clouds: first, by comparing semi-idealized large eddy simulations with observations; second, by dissecting the influences of different surface types and BL structures on Arctic mixed-phase clouds; third, by elucidating the dissipation process of Arctic mixed-phase clouds; and finally by analyzing the main microphysical processes inside Arctic mixed-phase clouds. The VERtical Distribution of Ice in Arctic clouds (VERDI) campaign was an aircraft campaign over the Beaufort Sea in spring 2012. Flights through clouds provide microphysical measurements inside mixed-phase clouds. Four different iAbstract cases are investigated and compared to simulations with the COnsortium for Small-Scale MOdeling (COSMO) model. In general, the simulated cloud top, cloud base, and the liquid water content (LWC) within the cloud layer agree well with the observations. Differences are seen in the droplet size distribution. The simulated mean cloud droplet sizes are smaller than the observed droplet sizes due to the prescribed shape of the distribution in the two-moment scheme of cloud microphysics. The deviation of the observed and simulated droplet diameter profiles from the wet adiabatic droplet diameter profile is similar. In addition, the cloud top structure is analyzed. Observations and simulations show an inhomogeneous characteristic of the cloud top structure. The outcome of this study is a validated model providing the basis for systematic sensitivity studies, which are described in more detail below. Different surface types cause variations in the sensible heat flux and in the latent heat flux. Thus, altered amount of moisture and heat can propagate into the BL. A first sensitivity study with three different surface types (sea ice, open lead, and sea water) shows that the structure of the BL and the surface type are important and influence the intensity of the surface fluxes. If the BL is well mixed to the surface, more moisture could reach the cloud layer and increase the cloud liquid water path. Particularly, the sea water surface influence the moisture transport by developing a well-mixed BL even when the BL is initially decoupled from the surface. This sensitivity study elucidates the influences of surface types and BL structures on Arctic mixed-phase clouds. The Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) campaign provides a large the Swedish icebreaker Oden as well as on a multi-year ice floe around 87{$\smwhtcircle$}N, where Oden was moored for three weeks in summer 2008. A second sensitivity study focus on an episode at the end of the ice drift on 31 August 2008. A low-level mixed-phase cloud was quasi-persistent for around a week and dissipated in the evening of 31 August 2008. At the same time, observations showed a decrease in CCN concentration. Simulations are performed to identify the main contributors to dissipation of this Arctic mixed-phase cloud. A set of three different sensitivity experiments mimic large-scale advection of dry air and advection of aerosol. Increasing ice crystal number concentration (ICNC) lead to dissipation of the cloud only at an ICNC of 10 l-1, which is unrealistically high for the Arctic. Drying the atmospheric layers below the cloud base has no influence on the mixed-phase iiAbstract cloud but drying the atmospheric layers above cloud top lead to a weakening of the liquid-dominated cloud layer. The main contributor for dissipation was found to be the reduction of cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to 2 cm-3 in this specific observed Arctic mixed-phase cloud. While in reality, it is likely that a combination of different processes contribute to dissipation, this study provides a detailed analyis of how each process contributes to dissipation. The same Arctic mixed-phase cloud during the ASCOS campaign as described before is analyzed to investigate the microphysical process rates inside clouds. Two groups of simulations, the diagnostic CDNC simulations with initial constant CDNC (30 cm-3 and 3 cm-3) and the prognostic simulations with aerosol number concentrations of 30 cm-3 and 80 cm-3, prescribed CCN, and prognostic CDNC were performed. The ICNC is altered from 0 l-1 to 1 l-1. Different microphysical process rates are analyzed and the relevant processes are revealed. The warm phase process (autoconversion of cloud droplets to raindrops) is strongest near the cloud top, which is the region where the highest LWC is simulated. Additionally, the strongest sedimentation rate of rain is near the cloud top in all simulations, except for the simulation with a CDNC of 3 cm-3, where a second layer at about 300 m above the surface and below the main cloud layer evolves. This cloud system finally dissipates. Varying the initial ICNC has no influence of the liquid droplet growth. Furthermore, the cloud lose condensate mainly via the liquid phase and not via the ice phase. The strongest ice phase process is the depositional growth of ice in the cloud layer, which indicates that the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process has a strong influence on the simulated Arctic mixed-phase cloud. Near the surface, the ice particles sublimates. This precise sensitivity study evaluates microphysical processes inside an Arctic mixed-phase cloud and detect the most important processes. On the whole, this thesis provides rigorous sensitivity analyses and elucidated important macrophysical and microphysical processes of Arctic mixed-phase clouds based on a validated high resolution model.},

These low-level clouds are frequently observed across the Arctic. They impact the turbulent and radiative heating of the open water, snow, and sea-ice-covered surfaces and in?uence the boundary layer structure. Therefore the processes that affect mixed-phase cloud life cycles are extremely important, yet relatively poorly understood. In this study, we present sensitivity studies using semi-idealized large eddy simulations (LESs) to identify processes contributing to the dissipation of Arctic mixed-phase clouds. We found that one potential main contributor to the dissipation of an observed Arctic mixed-phase cloud, during the Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study (ASCOS) ?eld campaign, was a low cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) of about 2 cm ?3 . Introducing a high ice crystal concentration of 10 L ?1 also resulted in cloud dissipation, but such high ice crystal concentrations were deemed unlikely for the present case. Sensitivity studies simulating the advection of dry air above the boundary layer inversion, as well as a modest increase in ice crystal concentration of 1 L ?1 , did not lead to cloud dissipation. As a requirement for small droplet numbers, pristine aerosol conditions in the Arctic environment are therefore considered an important factor determining the lifetime of Arctic mixed-phase clouds.},

Statistical algorithms were developed from a radiosonde data set in which clouds were modeled by using a relative humidity threshold and a modified adiabatic assumption. Evaluation of the algorithms was then performed by applying the algorithms to four data sets in which clouds were generated in different ways (i.e., threshold method, gradient method, and cloud microphysical model). While classical two-channel algorithms, in this case using frequencies at 22.985 and 28.235 GHz, do not show a significant dependency on the cloud model, the inclusion of an additional 50-GHz channel can introduce significant systematic errors. The addition of a 90-GHz frequency to the two-channel algorithm leads to a larger increase in LWP accuracy than in case of the 50-GHz channel and is less sensitive to the choice of cloud model. A drizzle case from the cloud microphysical model shows no significant loss of accuracy for the microwave radiometer algorithms, in contrast to simple cloud radar retrievals of liquid water. In case of rain, however, the results deteriorate when the total liquid water path is larger than 700 g m-2.},

Continuous and temporally highly resolved measurements that are specifically suited to characterize the diurnal cycle of water vapor, stability, and turbulence in the lower troposphere are performed with a special focus on atmosphere\textendash surface interaction. In addition, instruments are set up to measure the micro- and macrophysical properties of clouds in detail and how they interact with different boundary layer processes and the large-scale synoptic situation. For this, JOYCE is equipped with an array of state-of-the-art active and passive remote sensing and in situ instruments, which are briefly described in this scientific overview. As an example, a 24-h time series of the evolution of a typical cumulus cloud-topped boundary layer is analyzed with respect to stability, turbulence, and cloud properties. Additionally, we present longer-term statistics, which can be used to elucidate the diurnal cycle of water vapor, drizzle formation through autoconversion, and warm versus cold rain precipitation formation. Both case studies and long-term observations are important for improving the representation of clouds in climate and numerical weather prediction models.},

The measurements are taken from a cloud observatory recently established on the windward shore of Barbados. Cloud microphysical development is explored through an analysis of the radar echo of shallow cumuli before the development of active precipitation. The increase of reflectivity with height (Z gradient) depends on the amount of cloud water, which varies with meteorology, and cloud droplet number concentration N, which varies with the aerosol. Clouds with a large Z gradient have a higher tendency to form precipitation than clouds with a small Z gradient. Under similar meteorological conditions, the Z gradient is expected to be large in an environment with few aerosols and small in an environment with many aerosols. The aerosol environment is defined using three methods, but only one (based on the Raman lidar linear-depolarization ratio) to measure dusty conditions correlates significantly with the Z gradient. On average, nondusty days are characterized by a larger Z gradient. However, the dust concentration varies seasonally and covaries with relative humidity. Large-eddy simulations show that small changes in the relative humidity can have as much influence on the development of precipitation within the cloud layer as large changes in N. When clouds are conditioned on their ambient relative humidity, the sensitivity of the Z gradient to dust vanishes.},

A suite of cloud research radars, lidars, spectral and broadband radiometers, aerosol chemical and microphysical sampling equipment, and meteorological instrumentation was deployed at McMurdo Station on Ross Island from December 2015 through December 2016. A smaller suite of radiometers and meteorological equipment, including radiosondes optimized for surface energy budget measurement, was deployed on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet between 4 December 2015 and 17 January 2016. AWARE provided Antarctic atmospheric data comparable to several well-instrumented high Arctic sites that have operated for many years and that reveal numerous contrasts with the Arctic in aerosol and cloud microphysical properties. These include persistent differences in liquid cloud occurrence, cloud height, and cloud thickness. Antarctic aerosol properties are also quite different from the Arctic in both seasonal cycle and composition, due to the continent's isolation from lower latitudes by Southern Ocean storm tracks. Antarctic aerosol number and mass concentrations are not only non-negligible but perhaps play a more important role than previously recognized because of the higher sensitivities of clouds at the very low concentrations caused by the large-scale dynamical isolation. Antarctic aerosol chemical composition, particularly organic components, has implications for local cloud microphysics. The AWARE dataset, fully available online in the ARM Program data archive, offers numerous case studies for unique and rigorous evaluation of mixed-phase cloud parameterization in climate models.},

  abstract = {Ice clouds are known to be major contributors to radiative forcing in the Earth's atmosphere, yet describing their microphysical properties in climate models remains challenging. Among these properties, the ice water content (IWC) of cirrus clouds is of particular interest both because it is measurable and because it can be directly related to a number of other radiatively important variables such as extinction and effective radius. This study expands upon the work of Schiller et al. (2008), extending a climatology of IWC by combining datasets from several European and US airborne campaigns and ground-based lidar measurements over J\"ulich, Germany. The relationship between IWC and temperature is further investigated using the new merged dataset and probability distribution functions (PDFs). A PDF-based formulation allows for representation of not only the mean values of IWC, but also the variability of IWC within a temperature band. The IWC-PDFs are observed to be bimodal over the whole cirrus temperature range. This bimodality is also found in ice crystal number PDFs and might be attributed to different cirrus formation mechanisms such as heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing.},

  abstract = {The radiative role of ice clouds in the atmosphere is known to be important, but uncertainties remain concerning the magnitude and net effects. However, through measurements of the microphysical properties of cirrus clouds, we can better characterize them, which can ultimately allow for their radiative properties to be more accurately ascertained. Recently, two types of cirrus clouds differing by formation mechanism and microphysical properties have been classified \textendash{} in situ and liquid origin cirrus. In this study, we present observational evidence to show that two distinct types of cirrus do exist. Airborne, in situ measurements of cloud ice water content (IWC), ice crystal concentration (Nice), and ice crystal size from the 2014 ML-CIRRUS campaign provide cloud samples that have been divided according to their origin type. The key features that set liquid origin cirrus apart from the in situ origin cirrus are higher frequencies of high IWC ( {$>$} 100 ppmv), higher Nice values, and larger ice crystals. A vertical distribution of Nice shows that the in situ origin cirrus clouds exhibit a median value of around 0.1 cm-3, while the liquid origin concentrations are slightly, but notably higher. The median sizes of the crystals contributing the most mass are less than 200 \textmu m for in situ origin cirrus, with some of the largest crystals reaching 550 \textmu m in size. The liquid origin cirrus, on the other hand, were observed to have median diameters greater than 200 \textmu m, and crystals that were up to 750 \textmu m. An examination of these characteristics in relation to each other and their relationship to temperature provides strong evidence that these differences arise from the dynamics and conditions in which the ice crystals formed. Additionally, the existence of these two groups in cirrus cloud populations may explain why a bimodal distribution in the IWC-temperature relationship has been observed. We hypothesize that the low IWC mode is the result of in situ origin cirrus and the high IWC mode is the result of liquid origin cirrus.},

  abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program operates 35-GHz millimeter-wavelength cloud radars (MMCRs) in several climatologically distinct regions. The MMCRs, which are centerpiece instruments for the observation of clouds and precipitation, provide continuous, vertically resolved information on all hydrometeors above the ARM Climate Research Facilities (ACRF). However, their ability to observe clouds in the lowest 2\textendash 3 km of the atmosphere is often obscured by the presence of strong echoes from insects, especially during the warm months at the continental midlatitude Southern Great Plains (SGP) ACRF. Here, a new automated technique for the detection and elimination of insect-contaminated echoes from the MMCR observations is presented. The technique is based on recorded MMCR Doppler spectra, a feature extractor that conditions insect spectral signatures, and the use of a neural network algorithm for the generation of an insect (clutter) mask. The technique exhibits significant skill in the identification of insect radar returns (more than 92\% of insect-induced returns are identified) when the sole input to the classifier is the MMCR Doppler spectrum. The addition of circular polarization observations by the MMCR and ceilometer cloud-base measurements further improve the performance of the technique and form an even more reliable method for the removal of insect radar echoes at the ARM site. Recently, a 94-GHz Doppler polarimetric radar was installed next to the MMCR at the ACRF SGP site. Observations by both radars are used to evaluate the potential of the 94-GHz radar as being insect free and to show that dual wavelength radar reflectivity measurements can be used to identify insect radar returns.},

Millimeter wavelength cloud radars (MMCR) are able to penetrate and detect multiple cloud layers. However, in mixed-phase conditions, ice crystals dominate the radar signal, rendering the detection of liquid droplets from radar observables more difficult. The technique proposed here overcomes this fundamental limitation by using morphological features in MMCR Doppler spectra to detect supercooled liquid droplets in the radar sampling volume in the presence of ice particles. High lidar backscatter and near-zero lidar depolarization measurements (good indicators of the presence of liquid droplets) from the Mixed-Phase Arctic Clouds Experiment (MPACE) conducted in Barrow, Alaska, are used to train the technique and evaluate its potential for detecting mixed-phase conditions. Ceilometer, microwave radiometer, and radiosonde measurements provide additional independent validation. Because of the ability of MMCRs to penetrate multiple liquid layers, this radar-based technique does not suffer from the extinction limitations of lidars and is thus able to expand cloud phase identification methods to cloud regions beyond where lidars can penetrate, providing output at the native radar resolution. The technique is applicable to all profiling radars that have sufficient sensitivity to observe the small amount of liquid in mixed-phase clouds.},

  abstract = {The retrieval of cloud, drizzle, and turbulence parameters using radar Doppler spectra is challenged by the convolution of microphysical and dynamical influences and the overall uncertainty introduced by turbulence. A new technique that utilizes recorded radar Doppler spectra from profiling cloud radars is presented here. The technique applies to areas in clouds where drizzle is initially produced by the autoconversion process and is detected by a positive skewness in the radar Doppler spectrum. Using the Gaussian-shape property of cloud Doppler spectra, the cloud-only radar Doppler spectrum is estimated and used to separate the cloud and drizzle contributions. Once separated, the cloud spectral peak can be used to retrieve vertical air motion and eddy dissipation rates, while the drizzle peak can be used to estimate the three radar moments of the drizzle particle size distribution. The technique works for nearly 50\% of spectra found near cloud top, with efficacy diminishing to roughly 15\% of spectra near cloud base. The approach has been tested on a large dataset collected in the Azores during the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program (ARM) Mobile Facility deployment on Graciosa Island from May 2009 through December 2010. Validation of the proposed technique is achieved using the cloud base as a natural boundary between radar Doppler spectra with and without cloud droplets. The retrieval algorithm has the potential to characterize the dynamical and microphysical conditions at cloud scale during the transition from cloud to precipitation. This has significant implications for improving the understanding of drizzle onset in liquid clouds and for improving model parameterization schemes of autoconversion of cloud water into drizzle.},

Previous methods for automated classification have yielded moderate results that either can resolve few groups at high accuracy or many groups at relatively low accuracy. However, with the advent of new deep learning tools such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the automated identification of plankton images can be vastly improved. Here, we describe an image processing procedure that includes preprocessing, segmentation, classification, and postprocessing for the accurate identification of 108 classes of plankton using spatially sparse CNNs. Following a filtering process to remove images with low classification scores, a fully random evaluation of the classification showed that average precision was 84\% and recall was 40\% for all groups. Reliably classifying rare biological classes was difficult, so after excluding the 12 rarest taxa, classification accuracy for the remaining biological groups became {$>$} 90\%. This method provides proof of concept for the effectiveness of an automated classification scheme using deep-learning methods, which can be applied to a range of plankton or biological imaging systems, with the eventual application in a variety of ecological monitoring and fisheries management contexts.},

Measuring the sea surface skin temperature (SSTskin) with infrared radiometers onboard earth observation satellites and shipboard instruments is a mature subject spanning several decades. Reanalysis model output SSTskin, such as from the newly released ERA5, is very widely used and has been applied for monitoring climate change, weather prediction research, and other commercial applications. The ERA5 output SSTskin data must be rigorously evaluated to meet the stringent accuracy requirements for climate research. This study aims to estimate the accuracy of the ERA5 SSTskin fields and provide an associated error estimate by using measurements from accurate shipboard infrared radiometers: the Marine-Atmosphere Emitted Radiance Interferometers (M-AERIs). Overall, the ERA5 SSTskin has high correlation with ship-based radiometric measurements, with an average difference of 0.2 K with a Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.993. Parts of the discrepancies are related to dust aerosols and variability in air-sea temperature differences. The downward radiative flux due to dust aerosols leads to significant SSTskin differences for ERA5. The SSTskin differences are greater with the large, positive air\textendash sea temperature differences. This study provides suggestions for the applicability of ERA5 SSTskin fields in a selection of research applications.},

The main goal consists in the development of a turbulence closure for a microscale atmospheric model resolving the integrated effect of plumes emanated from leads, but not the individual convective eddies. To this end, 10 runs are carried out with a large eddy simulation (LES) model simulating the flow over leads for springtime atmospheric conditions with near-neutral inflow and a strong capping inversion. It is found that leads contribute to the stabilizing of the polar atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) and that strong countergradient fluxes of heat exist outside a core region of the plumes. These findings form the basis for the development of the new closure. It uses a new scaling with the internal ABL height and the characteristic vertical velocity for the plume region as the main governing parameters. Results of a microscale model obtained with the new closure agree well with the LES for variable meteorological forcing in case of lead orthogonal flow and for a fixed ABL height and lead width. The good agreement concerns especially the plume inclination, temperature, and heat fluxes as well as the relative contributions of gradient and countergradient transport of heat. A future more general closure should account, for example, for variable lead widths and wind directions. Results of the microscale model could be used to derive a future parameterization of the lead effect in large-scale models.},

The MRR is a low-cost, portable radar system that requires minimum supervision in the field. As such, the MRR is a frequently used radar system for conducting precipitation research. Current MRR drawbacks are the lack of a sophisticated post-processing algorithm to improve its sensitivity (currently at +3 dBz), spurious artefacts concerning radar receiver noise and the lack of high quality Doppler radar moments. Here we propose an improved processing method which is especially suited for snow observations and provides reliable values of effective reflectivity, Doppler velocity and spectral width. The proposed method is freely available on the web and features a noise removal based on recognition of the most significant peak. A dynamic dealiasing routine allows observations even if the Nyquist velocity range is exceeded. Collocated observations over 115 days of a MRR and a pulsed 35.2 GHz MIRA35 cloud radar show a very high agreement for the proposed method for snow, if reflectivities are larger than -5 dBz. The overall sensitivity is increased to -14 and -8 dBz, depending on range. The proposed method exploits the full potential of MRR's hardware and substantially enhances the use of Micro Rain Radar for studies of solid precipitation.},

The method relies on a functional relation between reflectivity and Doppler velocity. 2) The impact on the Doppler spectrum by replacing measurements of particle area and size distribution by recent analytical expressions is investigated. For this, higher-order moments such as skewness and kurtosis as well as the slopes of the Doppler spectrum are also used as a proxy for the Doppler spectrum. For the area\textendash size relation, it is found that a power law is not sufficient to describe particle area and small deviations from a power law are essential for obtaining consistent higher moments.

Depending on season, they can cool or warm the near-surface air. The radiative properties of these clouds depend strongly on cloud drop sizes, which are governed in part by the availability of cloud condensation nuclei. Here, we investigate how cloud drop sizes are modified in the presence of local emissions from industrial facilities at the North Slope of Alaska. For this, we use aircraft in situ observations of clouds and aerosols from the 5th Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (DOE ARM) Program's Airborne Carbon Measurements (ACME-V) campaign obtained in summer 2015. Comparison of observations from an area with petroleum extraction facilities (Oliktok Point) with data from a reference area relatively free of anthropogenic sources (Utqia\.gvik/Barrow) represents an opportunity to quantify the impact of local industrial emissions on cloud properties. In the presence of local industrial emissions, the mean effective radii of cloud droplets are reduced from 12.2 to 9.4 \textmu{} m, which leads to suppressed drizzle production and precipitation. At the same time, concentrations of refractory black carbon and condensation nuclei are enhanced below the clouds. These results demonstrate that the effects of anthropogenic pollution on local climate need to be considered when planning Arctic industrial infrastructure in a warming environment.},

Here, we investigate whether observations of microphysical processes of liquid clouds such as the transition of cloud droplets to drizzle drops can be used to calibrate cloud radars. Specifically, we study the relationships between the radar reflectivity factor and three variables not affected by absolute radar calibration: the skewness of the radar Doppler spectrum (?), the radar mean Doppler velocity (W), and the liquid water path (LWP). We identify reference points of these relationships and evaluate their potential for radar calibration. For Ka and W, we use box model simulations to determine typical radar re?ectivity values for these reference points. We apply the new methods to observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites North Slope of Alaska (NSA) and Oliktok Point (OLI) in 2016 using two 35 GHz Ka-band ARM Zenith Radars (KAZR). For periods with a suf?cient number of liquid cloud observations, we ?nd that the methods are robust enough for cloud radar calibration, with the LWP-based method performing best. We estimate that in 2016, the radar re?ectivity at NSA was about 1\dbend 1 dB too low, but stable. For OLI, we identify serious problems with maintaining an accurate calibration including a sudden decrease of 5 to 7 dB in June 2016.},

  abstract = {Retrieval datasets are prevalent and understanding the different sources of uncertainties in these datasets is critical to properly interpret and use these data.Remote sensing instruments are heavily used to provide observations for both the operational and research communities. These sensors do not provide direct observations of the desired atmospheric variables, but instead, retrieval algorithms are necessary to convert the indirect observations into the variable of interest. It is critical to be aware of the underlying assumptions made by many retrieval algorithms, including that the retrieval problem is often ill-posed and that there are various sources of uncertainty that need to be treated properly. In short, the retrieval challenge is to invert a set of noisy observations to obtain estimates of atmospheric quantities. The problem is often complicated by imperfect forward models, imperfect prior knowledge, and by the existence of nonunique solutions. Optimal Estimation (OE) is a widely used physical retrieval method that combines measurements, prior information, and the corresponding uncertainties based on Bayes' theorem to find an optimal solution for the atmospheric state. Furthermore, OE also allows the relative contributions of the different sources of error to the uncertainty in the final retrieved atmospheric state to be understood.Here, we provide a novel Python library to illustrate the use of OE for inverse problems in Atmospheric Sciences. We introduce two example problems: How to retrieve drop size distribution parameters from radar observations and how to retrieve the temperature profile from ground-based microwave sensors. Using these examples, we discuss common pitfalls, how the various error sources impact the retrieval and how the quality of the retrieval results can be quantified.},

These satellites are flown in a tight orbital configuration so that they probe nearly the same volumes of the atmosphere within 10\textendash 15 s of each other. This configuration combined with the capacity for millimeter radar to penetrate optically thick hydrometeor layers and the ability of the lidar to detect optically thin clouds has allowed us to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of hydrometeor layers with unprecedented precision. We find that the global hydrometeor coverage averages 76\% and demonstrates a fairly smooth annual cycle with a range of 3\% peaking in October 2006 and reaching a minimum in March 2007. The geographic distribution of hydrometeor layers defined in terms of layer base, layer top, and layer thickness is described. The predominance of geometrically thin boundary layer clouds is illustrated as is the spatial distribution of upper tropospheric ice clouds in the tropics. The cooccurrence of multiple layers is shown to be a strong function of latitude and geography with cooccurring middle-level (3 km {$<$} layer base {$<$} 6 km) and high-level (base {$>$} 6 km) layers being predominant over the continents. Cloud layer overlap is also examined, and a bias due to an assumption of maximum fractional overlap in coarse resolution models is quantified and shown to be on the order of -5 to -7\% globally maximizing over the high-latitude continents of the Northern Hemisphere.},

RL-GeoProf is one of the standard data products of the CloudSat Project. In this paper we describe updates to the RL-GeoProf algorithm. These improvements include a significant fix to the CALIPSO Vertical Feature Mask (VFM) that more accurately renders the occurrence frequencies of low-level clouds over the global oceans. Additionally, we now account for the navigational challenges associated with coordinated measurements of the two instruments by providing additional diagnostic information in the data files. We also document how the along-track averaging of the VFM influences the accuracy of RL-GeoProf. We find that the 5 km averaged VFM when merged with data from the CloudSat radar provides a global description of cloud occurrence that best matches an independently derived cloud mask from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MYD35) over daytime global oceans. Expanding on the comparison with MYD35, we demonstrate that RL-GeoProf and MYD35 closely track the monthly averaged cloud occurrence fraction during a 4 year span of measurements. A more detailed examination reveals latitudinal dependency in the comparison. Specifically, MYD35 tends to be significantly low biased relative to RL-GeoProf over the Polar Regions when cloud layers present low visible and thermal contrast with underlying surfaces. Additional analyses examine the geometrically defined hydrometeor layer occurrence climatologies over select regions of the Earth and the seasonal variations of low-based and low-topped cloud cover.},

Cloud properties are derived using data from W-band radars, lidars, and microwave radiometers using an optimal estimation algorithm. The SO clouds tended to have larger liquid water paths (LWP, 115 {$\pm$}117 g m-2), smaller effective radii (re, 8.7 {$\pm$}3um), and higher number concentrations (Nd, 90 {$\pm$}107 cm-3) than typical values of eastern ocean basin stratocumulus. The clouds demonstrated a tendency for the LWP to increase with Nd presumably due to precipitation suppression up to Nd of approximately 100 cm-3 when mean LWP decreased with increasing Nd. Due to higher optical depth, cloud albedos were less susceptible to changes in Nd compared to subtropical stratocumulus. The highest latitude clouds of the datasets, observed along and near the Antarctic coast, presented a distinctly bimodal character. One mode had the properties of marine clouds further north. The other mode occurred in an aerosol environment characterized by high cloud condensation nuclei concentrations and elevated sulfate aerosol without any obvious continental aerosol markers. These regions of higher CCN tend to have higher Nd, smaller re and higher LWP suggesting sensitivity of cloud properties to seasonal biogenic aerosol production in the high latitude SO},

Distribution-averaged mean single scattering properties are calculated for hexagonal columns, hexagonal plates, and polycrystals at a nonabsorbing (0.5 {$\mu$}m), moderately absorbing (1.6 {$\mu$}m), and strongly absorbing (3.0 {$\mu$}m) wavelength. At 0.5 {$\mu$}m (1.6 {$\mu$}m) (3.0 {$\mu$}m), the spread in the resulting mean asymmetry parameters due to different SDs is smaller than (comparable to) (smaller than) the difference caused by applying different particle shapes to these distributions. From a broadband solar radiative transfer point of view it appears more important to use the correct particle shapes than to average over the correct size distributions.},

A broad array of recent research has emphasized that photon-particle scattering calculations are very sensitive to ice particle morphology, complexity, and surface roughness. Uncertain variations in these parameters have major implications for successfully parameterizing the radiative ramifications of cirrus clouds in climate models. To date, characterization of the microscale details of cirrus particle morphology has been limited by the particles' inaccessibility and technical difficulty in capturing imagery with sufficient resolution. Results from a new experimental system achieve much higher resolution images of cirrus ice particles than existing airborne particle imaging systems. The novel system (Ice Cryo-Encapsulation by Balloon, ICE-Ball) employs a balloon-borne payload with environmental sensors and hermetically-sealed cryo-encapsulation cells. The payload captures ice particles from cirrus clouds, seals them, and returns them via parachute for vapor-locked transfer onto a cryo-scanning electron microscopy stage (cryo-SEM). From 2016\textendash 2019, the ICE-Ball system has successfully yielded high resolution particle images on nine cirrus-penetrating flights. On several flights, including one highlighted here in detail, thousands of cirrus particles were retrieved and imaged, revealing unanticipated particle morphologies, extensive habit heterogeneity, multiple scales of mesoscale roughening, a wide array of embedded aerosol particles, and even greater complexity than expected.},

  abstract = {The radiative energy budget in the Arctic undergoes a rapid transformation compared with global mean changes. Understanding the role of cirrus clouds in this system is vital, as they interact with short- and long-wave radiation, and the presence of cirrus can be decisive as to a net gain or loss of radiative energy in the polar atmosphere. In an effort to derive the radiative properties of cirrus in a real scenario in this sensitive region, we use in situ measurements of the ice water content (IWC) performed during the Polar Stratosphere in a Changing Climate (POLSTRACC) aircraft campaign in the boreal winter and spring 2015\textendash 2016 employing the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO). A large dataset of IWC measurements of mostly thin cirrus at high northern latitudes was collected in the upper troposphere and also frequently in the lowermost stratosphere. From this dataset, we select vertical profiles that sampled the complete vertical extent of cirrus cloud layers. These profiles exhibit a vertical IWC structure that will be shown to control the instantaneous radiative effect in both the long and short wavelength regimes in the polar winter. We perform radiative transfer calculations with the uvspec model from the libRadtran software package in a one-dimensional column between the surface and the top of the atmosphere (TOA), using the IWC profiles as well as the state of the atmospheric column at the time of measurement, as given by weather forecast products, as input. In parameter studies, we vary the surface albedo and solar zenith angle in ranges typical of the Arctic region. We find the strongest (positive) radiative forcing up to about 48 W m-2 for cirrus over bright snow, whereas the forcing is mostly weaker and even ambiguous, with a rather symmetric range of values down to -35 W m-2, over the open ocean in winter and spring. The IWC structure over several kilometres in the vertical affects the irradiance at the TOA via the distribution of optical thickness. We show the extent to which IWC profiles with a coarser vertical resolution can reflect this effect. Further, a highly variable heating rate profile within the cloud is found which drives dynamical processes and contributes to the thermal stratification at the tropopause. Our case studies highlight the importance of a detailed resolution of cirrus clouds and the consideration of surface albedo for estimations of the radiative energy budget in the Arctic.},

Results from experiments in the eastern Pacific, South Atlantic, subtropical regions of the North Atlantic, and the sea areas around the British Isles are presented. In situations where entrainment effects are small the (effective radius)3 is found to be a linear function of the (volume-averaged radius)3 in a given cloud and can thus be parameterized with respect to the liquid water content and the droplet number concentration in the cloud. However, the shape of the droplet size spectrum is very dependent on the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) characteristics below cloud base, and the relationship between effective radius and volume-averaged radius varies between maritime air masses and continental air masses. This study also details comparisons that have been made in stratocumulus between the droplet number concentrations and (a) aerosol concentrations below cloud base in the size range 0.1 to 3.0 {$\mu$}m and (b) CCN supersaturation spectra in the boundary layer. A parameterization relating droplet concentration and aerosol concentration is suggested. The effects of nonadiabatic processes on the parameterization of effective radius are discussed. Drizzle is found to have little effect near cloud top, but in precipitating stratocumulus clouds the parameterization breaks down near cloud base. Comparisons are made between this parameterization of effective radius and others used currently or in the past.},

In a novel optimal estimation retrieval, mean Doppler velocity is exploited to retrieve a density factor parameter, which modulates the mass, shape, terminal velocity, and backscatter cross sections of ice particles. In a case study including aggregate snow and graupel we find that snow rate and ensemble mean ice density can be retrieved to within 50\% of in situ measurements at the surface using dual-frequency Doppler radar retrievals. While Doppler measurements are essential to the retrieval of particle density, the dual-frequency ratio provides a strong constraint on particle size. The retrieved density factor is strongly correlated with liquid water path, indicating that riming is the primary process by which the density factor is modulated. Using liquid water path as a proxy for riming, profiles classified as unrimed snow, rimed snow, and graupel exhibit distinct features characteristic of aggregation and riming processes, suggesting the potential to make estimates of process rates from these retrievals. We discuss the potential application of the technique to future satellite missions.},

  abstract = {A method to estimate cloud particle orientation and shape parameters using a polarization diversity radar is presented. The method is demonstrated for low-reflectivity ice clouds containing crystals that are modeled as prolate and oblate spheroids. The parameters to be estimated are the particle mean canting angle and the axis ratio in the incident wave polarization plane. The scattering matrix concept is used to obtain a relationship between two orthogonally polarized received powers and the parameters of interest. It is shown that the use of an elliptically polarized radar signal diminishes the expected difference between received powers in the two receiving polarization channels. This makes polarization studies of ice clouds with relatively low reflectivities possible; these clouds often are ``invisible'' in one of the receiving channels when conventional linear or circular polarization is used. An estimation of errors in the retrieved mean canting angle value caused by the spread in particle orientation is also given.},

These parameters are the particle characteristic size and ice mass content. The method also allows calculations of vertical profiles of particle concentrations and ice mass flux. The method uses measurements of radar reflectivities and Doppler velocities from the ground-based zenith-viewing radar combined with measurements of downwelling brightness temperatures from an infrared radiometer operating in the ``window'' (1012 \textmu m) region. The proposed method is illustrated on data obtained on 26 November 1991 during FIRE-II [First ISCCP (International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) Regional Experiment] in Coffeyville, Kansas. This paper also presents estimates of uncertainties of parameter retrieval due to different a priori assumptions about particle shapes, distributions, fall velocity-size relationships and due to errors in measurements.

  abstract = {An approach is suggested to relate measurements of radar depolarization ratios and aspect ratios of predominant hydrometeors in nonprecipitating and weakly precipitating layers of winter clouds. The trends of elevation angle dependencies of depolarization ratios are first used to distinguish between columnar-type and plate-type particles. For the established particle type, values of depolarization ratios observed at certain elevation angles, for which the influence of particle orientation is minimal, are then used to estimate aspect ratios when information on particle effective bulk density is assumed or inferred from other measurements. The use of different polarizations, including circular, slant-45\textdegree{} linear, and two elliptical polarizations, is discussed. These two elliptical polarizations are quasi-circular and quasi-linear slant-45\textdegree{} linear, and both are currently achievable with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Environmental Technology Laboratory's Ka-band radar. In comparison with the true circular and slant-45\textdegree{} linear polarizations, the discussed elliptical polarizations provide a stronger signal in the ``weak'' radar receiver channel; however, it is at the expense of diminished dynamic range of depolarization ratio variations. For depolarization measurements at the radar elevation angles that do not show much sensitivity to particle orientations, the available quasi-circular polarization provides a better depolarization contrast between nonspherical and spherical particles than does the available quasi-linear slant-45\textdegree{} polarization. The use of the proposed approach is illustrated with the experimental data collected during a recent field experiment. It is shown that it allows successful differentiation among pristine planar crystals, rimed planar crystals, long columns, blocky columns, and graupel. When a reasonable assumption about particle bulk density is made, quantitative estimates of particle aspect ratios from radar depolarization data are in good agreement with in situ observations. Uncertainties of particle aspect ratios estimated from depolarization measurements due to 0.1 g cm-3 variations in the assumed bulk density are about 0.1.},

Radar and accompanying cloud microphysical measurements were conducted during the Storm Peak Laboratory Cloud Property Validation Experiment held in Steamboat Springs, Colorado, during the winter season of 2010/11. The observed ice hydrometeor habits ranged from pristine and rimed dendrites/ stellars to aggregates, irregulars, graupel, columns, plates, and particle mixtures. The slant 458 linear depolarization ratio (SLDR) trends as a function of the radar elevation angle are indicative of the predominant hydrometeor habit/shape. For planar particles, SLDR values increase from values close to the radar polarization cross coupling of about 221.8 dB at zenith viewing to maximum values at slant viewing. These maximum values depend on predominant aspect ratio and bulk density of hydrometeors and also show some sensitivity to particle characteristic size. The highest observed SLDRs were around 28 dB for pristine dendrites. Unlike planar-type hydrometeors, columnar-type particles did not exhibit pronounced depolarization trends as a function of viewing direction. A difference in measured SLDR values between zenith and slant viewing can be used to infer predominant aspect ratios of planar hydrometeors if an assumption about their bulk density is made. For columnar hydrometeors, SLDR offsets from the cross-coupling value are indicative of aspect ratios. Experimental data were analyzed for a number of events with prevalence of planartype hydrometeors and also for observations when columnar particles were the dominant species. A relatively simple spheroidal model and accompanying T-matrix calculations were able to approximate most radar depolarization changes with viewing angle observed for different hydrometeor types.},

Nonsphericity is characterized by aspect ratios representing the ratios of particle minor-to-major dimensions. The approach is based on the use of a circular depolarization ratio (CDR) proxy reconstructed from differential reflectivity ZDR and copolar correlation coefficient rhy linear polarization measurements. Essentially combining information contained in ZDR and rhy, CDR-based retrievals of aspect ratios are fairly insensitive to hydrometeor orientation if measurements are performed at elevation angles of around 40\textdegree\textendash 50\textdegree. The suggested approach is applied to data collected using the third ARM Mobile Facility (AMF3), deployed to Oliktok Point, Alaska. Aspect ratio retrievals were also performed using ZDR measurements that are more strongly (compared to CDR) influenced by hydrometeor orientation. The results of radar-based retrievals are compared with in situ measurements from the tethered balloon system (TBS)-based video ice particle sampler and the ground-based multiangle snowflake camera. The observed ice hydrometeors were predominantly irregular-shaped ice crystals and aggregates, with aspect ratios varying between approximately 0.3 and 0.8. The retrievals assume that particle bulk density influencing (besides the particle shape) observed polarimetric variables can be deduced from the estimates of particle characteristic size. Uncertainties of CDR-based aspectratio retrievals are estimated at about 0.1\textendash 0.15. Given these uncertainties, radar-based retrievals generally agreed with in situ measurements. The advantages of using the CDR proxy compared to the linear depolarization ratio are discussed.},

  abstract = {The influence of ice hydrometeor shape on the dual-wavelength ratio (DWR) of radar reflectivities at millimeter-wavelength frequencies is studied theoretically and on the basis of observations. Data from dual-frequency (Ka\textendash{} W bands) radar show that, for vertically pointing measurements, DWR increasing trends with reflectivity Ze are very pronounced when Ka-band Ze is greater than about 0 dBZ and that DWR and Ze values are usually well correlated. This correlation is explained by strong relations between hydrometeor characteristic size and both of these radar variables. The observed DWR variability for a given level of reflectivity is as large as 8 dB, which is in part due to changes in mean hydrometeor shape as expressed in terms of the particle aspect ratio. Hydrometeors with a higher degree of nonsphericity exhibit lower DWR values when compared with quasi-spherical particles because of near-zenith reflectivity enhancements for particles outside the Rayleigh-scattering regime. When particle mass\textendash{} size relations do not change significantly (e.g., for low-rime conditions), DWR can be used to differentiate between quasi-spherical and highly nonspherical hydrometeors because (for a given reflectivity value) DWR tends to increase as particles become more spherical. Another approach for differentiating among different degrees of nonsphericity for larger scatterers is based on analyzing DWR changes as a function of radar elevation angle. These changes are more pronounced for highly nonspherical particles and can exceed 10 dB. Measurements of snowfall spatiotemporally collocated with spaceborne CloudSat W-band radar and ground-based S-band operational weather radars also indicate that DWR values are generally smaller for ice hydrometeors with higher degrees of nonsphericity, which, for the same level of S-band reflectivity, exhibit greater differential reflectivity values.},

The mean aspect ratio, which is defined by the hydrometeor minor-to-major dimension ratio for a spheroidal particle model, is retrieved as a particle shape parameter. The radar variables used for aspect ratio profile retrievals include reflectivity, differential reflectivity, and the copolar correlation coefficient. The retrievals indicate that hydrometeors with mean aspect ratios below 0.2\textendash 0.3 are usually present in regions with air temperatures warmer than approximately from -17\textdegree{} to -15\textdegree C, corresponding to a regime that has been shown to be favorable for growth of pristine ice crystals of planar habits. Radar reflectivities corresponding to the lowest mean aspect ratios are generally between -10 and 10 dBZ. For colder temperatures, mean aspect ratios are typically in a range between 0.3 and 0.8. There is a tendency for hydrometeor aspect ratios to increase as particles transition from altitudes in the temperature range from -17\textdegree{} to -15\textdegree C toward the ground. This increase is believed to result from aggregation and riming processes that cause particles to become more spherical and is associated with areas demonstrating differential reflectivity decreases with increasing reflectivity. Aspect ratio retrievals at the lowest altitudes are consistent with in situ measurements obtained using a surface-based multiangle snowflake camera. Pronounced gradients in particle aspect ratio profiles are observed at altitudes at which there is a change in the dominant hydrometeor species, as inferred by spectral measurements from a vertically pointing Doppler radar.},

The hydrometeor shape information is described in terms of their aspect ratios, r, which represent the ratio of particle minor and major dimensions. The method is based on the relations between depolarization ratio (DR) estimates and aspect ratios. DR values, which are a proxy for circular depolarization ratio, were reconstructed from radar variables of reflectivity factor, Ze , differential reflectivity, ZDR, and copolar correlation coefficient {$\rho$}hv, which are available from radar systems operating in either simultaneous or alternate transmutation of horizontally and vertically polarized signals. DR-r relations were developed for retrieving aspect ratios and their sensitivity to different assumptions and model uncertainties were discussed. To account for changing particle bulk density, which is a major contributor to the retrieval uncertainty, an approach is suggested to tune the DR-r relations using reflectivity-based estimates of characteristic hydrometeor size. The analyzed events include moderate snowfall observed by an operational S-band weather radar and a precipitating ice cloud observed by a scanning Ka-band cloud radar at an Arctic location. Uncertainties of the retrievals are discussed.},

  abstract = {Dual-frequency millimeter-wavelength radar observations in snowfall are analyzed in order to evaluate differences in conventional polarimetric radar variables such as differential reflectivity (ZDR) specific differential phase shift (KDP) and linear depolarization ratio (LDR) at traditional cloud radar frequencies at Ka and W bands ( 35 and 94 GHz, correspondingly). Low radar beam elevation ( 5\textdegree ) measurements were performed at Oliktok Point, Alaska, with a scanning fully polarimetric radar operating in the horizontal\textendash vertical polarization basis. This radar has the same gate spacing and very close beam widths at both frequencies, which largely alleviates uncertainties associated with spatial and temporal data matching. It is shown that observed Ka- and W-band ZDR differences are, on average, less than about 0.5 dB and do not have a pronounced trend as a function of snowfall reflectivity. The observed ZDR differences agree well with modeling results obtained using integration over nonspherical ice particle size distributions. For higher signal-to-noise ratios, KDP data derived from differential phase measurements are approximately scaled as reciprocals of corresponding radar frequencies indicating that the influence of non-Rayleigh scattering effects on this variable is rather limited. This result is also in satisfactory agreement with data obtained by modeling using realistic particle size distributions. Observed Ka- and W-band LDR differences are strongly affected by the radar hardware system polarization ``leak'' and are generally less than 4 dB. Smaller differences are observed for higher depolarizations, where the polarization ``leak'' is less pronounced. Realistic assumptions about particle canting and the system polarization isolation lead to modeling results that satisfactorily agree with observational dual-frequency LDR data.},

In order to minimize such negative health impacts, the general public and the public health authorities are informed and warned by means of an advanced procedure known as a ``heat health warning system'' (HHWS). It is aimed at triggering interventions and at taking preventive measures. The HHWS in Germany has been in operation since 2005. The present work is aimed at showing the updated structure of an advanced HHWS that has been developed further several times during its 15 years of operation. This is to impart knowledge to practitioners about the concept of the system. In Germany, dangerous heat episodes are predicted on the basis of the numerical weather forecast. The perceived temperature as an appropriate thermal index is calculated and used to assess the levels of heat stress. The thermo-physiologically based procedure contains variable thresholds taking into account the short time acclimatization of the people. The forecast system further comprises the nocturnal indoor conditions, the specific characteristics of the elderly population, and the elevation of a region. The heat warnings are automatically generated, but they are published with possible adjustments and a compulsory confirmation by the biometeorology forecaster. Preliminary studies indicate a reduction in the heat related outcomes. In addition, the extensive duration of the strongest heat wave in summer 2018, which lasted three weeks, highlights the necessity of the HHWS to protect human health and life.},

This evaluation was conducted using a 4-week observation period from the Arctic Ocean 2018 expedition, where the transition from sea ice melting to freezing conditions was measured. Three different cloud schemes were tested within a nested limited-area model (LAM) configuration of the UM \textendash{} two regionally operational single-moment schemes (UM\_RA2M and UM\_RA2T) and one novel double-moment scheme (UM\_CASIM-100) \textendash{} while one global simulation was conducted with the IFS, utilising its default cloud scheme (ECMWF\_IFS).  Consistent weaknesses were identified across both models, with both the UM and IFS overestimating cloud occurrence below 3 km. This overestimation was also consistent across the three cloud configurations used within the UM framework, with \&gt;90 \% mean cloud occurrence simulated between 0.15 and 1 km in all the model simulations. However, the cloud microphysical structure, on average, was modelled reasonably well in each simulation, with the cloud liquid water content (LWC) and ice water content (IWC) comparing well with observations over much of the vertical profile. The key microphysical discrepancy between the models and observations was in the LWC between 1 and 3 km, where most simulations (all except UM\_RA2T) overestimated the observed LWC.  Despite this reasonable performance in cloud physical structure, both models failed to adequately capture cloud-free episodes: this consistency in cloud cover likely contributes to the ever-present near-surface temperature bias in every simulation. Both models also consistently exhibited temperature and moisture biases below 3 km, with particularly strong cold biases coinciding with the overabundant modelled cloud layers. These biases are likely due to too much cloud-top radiative cooling from these persistent modelled cloud layers and were consistent across the three UM configurations tested, despite differences in their parameterisations of cloud on a sub-grid scale. Alarmingly, our findings suggest that these biases in the regional model were inherited from the global model, driving a cause\textendash effect relationship between the excessive low-altitude cloudiness and the coincident cold bias. Using representative cloud condensation nuclei concentrations in our double-moment UM configuration while improving cloud microphysical structure does little to alleviate these biases; therefore, no matter how comprehensive we make the cloud physics in the nested LAM configuration used here, its cloud and thermodynamic structure will continue to be overwhelmingly biased by the meteorological conditions of its driving model.},

The parameterization is mass conserving, accurately represents small ice crystals, and is easily integrable. The parameterization gives accurate estimates of mass, area, and number contained in different size ranges. The radiative properties estimated from midlatitude parameterizations are compared with those estimated from this parameterization using anomalous diffraction theory. As opposed to some previous studies, small crystals do not dominate the mass and radiative properties of cirrus. Comparison with midlatitude observations shows that size distribution shape can vary substantially depending on where, when, and how the cirrus is measured and on how it forms.},

  abstract = {Single scattering shortwave properties of ice clouds are frequently derived in terms of the ``effective'' radius (re) of the ice crystal population. Substantial discrepancies between definitions exist, making interpretation and comparison of various radiative parameterization schemes and satellite retrieval techniques difficult. Each definition of effective radius can be related to more physically based parameters, such as the crystal dimension of median mass. For vertically inhomogeneous clouds, the relative importance of different cloud heights in determining the retrieved re is examined, and a definition of re for vertically inhomogeneous clouds composed of hexagonal columns is proposed. This definition shows reasonable agreement with the re values that would be retrieved using visible and near-infrared channels for some microphysical data acquired in tropical ice clouds near Kwajalein, Marshall Islands, in the mid-1970s. Because only the upper parts of a thick ice cloud are detected by satellite, and because the near-infrared channels demonstrate reduced sensitivity to large crystals, it may not be possible to obtain information about typical particle sizes over the entire depth of thick clouds using current satellite retrievals alone.},

Results from two instrument systems, one comprising a vertical array of four turbulence-measuring instrument clusters, the other an automated, loose-tethered microstructure profiler, show that forcing by modest surface fluxes (surface friction velocity u.0 - 0.7 cm s -\textbullet{} surface buoyancy flux (w'b')o \textbullet{} -0.7 x 10 -7 W kg -\textbullet ) substantially changes the scales and character of boundary layer turbulence relative to forcing by stress alone. Despite continuous freezing at the surface a diurnal cycle of heating and cooling of the mixed layer was seen, with downward oceanic heat flux as high as 70 W m -2 observed at middepth in the mixed layer near solar noon. Heat flux was determined both by direct eddy covariance of temperature and vertical velocity at fixed levels and from TKE and thermal dissipation estimates from the profiling instrument, with reasonable agreement. Similarly, there was close correspondence between TKE dissipation estimates obtained from inertial subrange spectral levels at the fixed instruments and from microstructure shear profiles. TKE production was dominated by buoyancy flux through most of the boundary layer. Thermal and saline eddy diffusivities were computed from directly measured fluxes and mixed layer temperature and salinity gradients, with mean values of 0.046 and 0.049 m 2 s -1 for temperature and salinity, respectively. Kolmogorov constants for relating thermal and saline dissipations to inertial subrange spectral levels were found to be 0.9 and 1.0, respectively, but with large scatter.},

We present a description of HAMP's instrumentation together with an illustration of its potential. To demonstrate this potential, synthetic measurements for the implemented passive microwave frequencies and the cloud radar based on cloud-resolving and radiative transfer model calculations were performed. These illustrate the advantage of HAMP's chosen frequency coverage, which allows for improved detection of hydrometeors both via the emission and scattering of radiation. Regression algorithms compare HAMP retrieval with standard satellite instruments from polar orbiters and show its advantages particularly for the lower atmosphere with a root-mean-square error reduced by 5 and 15\% for temperature and humidity, respectively. HAMP's main advantage is the high spatial resolution of about 1 km, which is illustrated by first measurements from test flights. Together these qualities make it an exciting tool for gaining a better understanding of cloud processes, testing retrieval algorithms, defining future satellite instrument specifications, and validating platforms after they have been placed in orbit.},

MiRAC combines a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar at 94 GHz including a 89 GHz passive channel (MiRAC-A) and an eight channel radiometer with frequencies between 175 and 340 GHz (MiRAC-P). The radar can be flexibly operated using 5 different chirp sequences to provide measurements of the equivalent radar reflectivity with different vertical resolution down to 5 m. MiRAC is mounted for down-looking geometry on Polar 5 to enable the synergy with lidar and radiation measurements. To mitigate the influence of the strong surface backscatter the radar is mounted with an inclination of about 25{$\smwhtcircle$} backward in a belly pod under the Polar 5 aircraft. Procedures for filtering ground return and range side-lobes have been developed. MiRAC-P frequencies are especially adopted for low humidity conditions typical for the Arctic to provide information on 10 water vapor and hydrometeor content. MiRAC has been operated on 19 research flights during the ACLOUD campaign in the vicinity of Svalbard in May/June 2017 providing in total 48 hours of measurements from flight altitudes {$>$} 2300 m. The radar measurements have been carefully quality controlled and corrected for surface clutter, mounting of the instrument, and aircraft orientation to provide measurements on a unified, geo-referenced vertical grid allowing the combination with the other nadir pointing instruments. An intercomparison with CloudSat shows good agreement in terms of cloud top height of 1.5 km and 15 radar reflectivity up to -5 dBz and demonstrates that MiRAC is able to fill the gap in observing low level clouds with its more than ten times higher vertical resolution down to about 150 m above the surface. This is especially important for the Arctic as about 45 \% of the clouds during ACLOUD showed cloud tops below 1200 m, i.e., the blind zone of CloudSat.},

In this way, they are an integral part of inversion algorithms that aim to retrieve geophysical variables from observations or in data assimilation.

Herein, CRM profiles or fields provide the input to the forward model whose simulation results are subsequently compared to the observations. This paper introduces the freely available comprehensive microwave forward model PAMTRA (Passive and Active Microwave TRAnsfer), demonstrates its capabilities to simulate passive and active measurements across the microwave spectral region for upward- and downward-looking geometries, and illustrates how the forward simulations can be used to evaluate CRMs and to interpret measurements to improve our understanding of cloud processes.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}PAMTRA is unique as it treats passive and active radiative transfer (RT) in a consistent way with the passive forward model providing upwelling and downwelling polarized brightness temperatures and radiances for arbitrary observation angles.

In three analyzed cases, the values of the retrieved axis ratio were in an interval from 0.15 to 0.4 and {$\sigma\theta$} found in an interval from 2\textdegree{} to 20\textdegree.

Ambiguities in the retrievals because of uncertainties in the bulk ice density of the particles and possible presence of columnar crystals are considered.

  abstract = {Cloud properties from both ground-based as well as from geostationary passive satellite observations have been used previously for diagnosing aerosol\textendash cloud interactions. In this investigation, a 2-year data set together with four selected case studies are analyzed with the aim of evaluating the consistency and limitations of current ground-based and satellite-retrieved cloud property data sets. The typically applied adiabatic cloud profile is modified using a sub-adiabatic factor to account for entrainment within the cloud. Based on the adiabatic factor obtained from the combination of ground-based cloud radar, ceilometer and microwave radiometer, we demonstrate that neither the assumption of a completely adiabatic cloud nor the assumption of a constant sub-adiabatic factor is fulfilled (mean adiabatic factor 0.63{$\pm$}0.22). As cloud adiabaticity is required to estimate the cloud droplet number concentration but is not available from passive satellite observations, an independent method to estimate the adiabatic factor, and thus the influence of mixing, would be highly desirable for global-scale analyses. Considering the radiative effect of a cloud described by the sub-adiabatic model, we focus on cloud optical depth and its sensitivities. Ground-based estimates are here compared vs. cloud optical depth retrieved from the Meteosat SEVIRI satellite instrument resulting in a bias of -4 and a root mean square difference of 16. While a synergistic approach based on the combination of ceilometer, cloud radar and microwave radiometer enables an estimate of the cloud droplet concentration, it is highly sensitive to radar calibration and to assumptions about the moments of the droplet size distribution. Similarly, satellite-based estimates of cloud droplet concentration are uncertain. We conclude that neither the ground-based nor satellite-based cloud retrievals applied here allow a robust estimate of cloud droplet concentration, which complicates its use for the study of aerosol\textendash cloud interactions.},

Clouds and in particular mixed-phase clouds(MPCs) remain one of the greatest sources of uncertainties inthe modelling of the Arctic response to climate change dueto an inaccurate representation of their variability and theirquantification. In this study, we present a characterisation ofthe vertical, spatial and seasonal variability of Arctic cloudsand MPCs over the entire Arctic region based on satelliteactive remote sensing observations. MPC properties in theregion of the Svalbard archipelago (78 N, 15 E) are also investigated.The occurrence frequency of clouds and MPCsare determined from CALIPSO/CLOUDSAT measurementsprocessed with the DARDAR retrieval algorithm, which allowfor a reliable cloud thermodynamic phase classification(warm liquid, supercooled liquid, ice, mixing of ice and supercooledliquid). Significant differences are observed betweenMPC properties over the entire Arctic region and overthe Svalbard region. Results show that MPCs are encounteredall year long, with a minimum occurrence of 30\% inwinter and 50\% during the rest of the year on average overthe entire Arctic. Over the Svalbard region, MPC occurrenceis more constant with time with larger values (55 \%) comparedto the average observed in the Arctic. MPCs are especiallylocated at low altitudes, below 3000 m, where theirfrequency of occurrence reaches 90 \%, particularly duringwinter, spring and autumn. Moreover, results highlight thatMPCs are statistically more frequent above open sea thanland or sea ice. The temporal and spatial distribution ofMPCs over the Svalbard region seems to be linked to thesupply of moister air and warmer water from the North AtlanticOcean, which contribute to the initiation of the liquidwater phase. Over the whole Arctic, and particularly in westernregions, the increase of MPC occurrence from spring toautumn could be connected to the sea ice melting. Duringthis period, the open water transports some of the warm waterfrom the North Atlantic Ocean to the rest of the Arcticregion. This facilitates the vertical transfer of moisture andthus the persistence of the liquid phase. Particular attentionis also paid to the measurement uncertainties and how theycould affect our conclusions.},

  abstract = {Based on boundary layer theory and a comparison of empirical power laws relating the Reynolds and Best numbers, it was apparent that the primary variables governing a hydrometeor's terminal velocity were its mass, its area projected to the flow, and its maximum dimension. The dependence of terminal velocities on surface roughness appeared secondary, with surface roughness apparently changing significantly only during phase changes (i.e., ice to liquid). In the theoretical analysis, a new, comprehensive expression for the drag force, which is valid for both inertial and viscous-dominated flow, was derived. A hydrometeor's mass and projected area were simply and accurately represented in terms of its maximum dimension by using dimensional power laws. Hydrometeor terminal velocities were calculated by using mass- and area-dimensional power laws to parameterize the Best number, X. Using a theoretical relationship general for all particle types, the Reynolds number, Re, was then calculated from the Best number. Terminal velocities were calculated from Re. Alternatively, four Re\textendash X power-law expressions were extracted from the theoretical Re\textendash X relationship. These expressions collectively describe the terminal velocities of all ice particle types. These were parameterized using mass- and area-dimensional power laws, yielding four theoretically based power-law expressions predicting fall speeds in terms of ice particle maximum dimension. When parameterized for a given ice particle type, the theoretical fall speed power law can be compared directly with empirical fall speed-dimensional power laws in the literature for the appropriate Re range. This provides a means of comparing theory with observations. Terminal velocities predicted by this method were compared with fall speeds given by empirical fall speed expressions for the same ice particle type, which were curve fits to measured fall speeds. Such comparisons were done for nine types of ice particles. Fall speeds predicted by this method differed from those based on measurements by no more than 20\%. The features that distinguish this method of determining fall speeds from others are that it does not represent particles as spheroids, it is general for any ice particle shape and size, it is conceptually and mathematically simple, it appears accurate, and it provides for physical insight. This method also allows fall speeds to be determined from aircraft measurements of ice particle mass and projected area, rather than directly measuring fall speeds. This approach may be useful for ice crystals characterizing cirrus clouds, for which direct fall speed measurements are difficult.},

The molecular species treated in the model are water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide, and the common halocarbons. The radiative transfer in RRTM is performed using the correlated-k method: the k distributions are attained directly from the LBLRTM line-by-line model, which connects the absorption coefficients used by RRTM to high-resolution radiance validations done with observations. Refined methods have been developed for treating bands containing gases with overlapping absorption, for the determination of values of the Planck function appropriate for use in the correlated-k approach, and for the inclusion of minor absorbing species in a band. The flux and cooling rate results of RRTM are linked to measurement through the use of LBLRTM, which has been substantially validated with observations. Validations of RRTM using LBLRTM have been performed for the midlatitude summer, tropical, midlatitude winter, subarctic winter, and four atmospheres from the Spectral Radiance Experiment campaign. On the basis of these validations the longwave accuracy of RRTM for any atmosphere is as follows: 0.6 W m-2 (relative to LBLRTM) for net flux in each band at all altitudes, with a total (10\textendash 3000 cm-1) error of less than 1.0 W m-2 at any altitude; 0.07 K d-1 for total cooling rate error in the troposphere and lower stratosphere, and 0.75 K d-1 in the upper stratosphere and above. Other comparisons have been performed on RRTM using LBLRTM to gauge its sensitivity to changes in the abundance of specific species, including the halocarbons and carbon dioxide. The radiative forcing due to doubling the concentration of carbon dioxide is attained with an accuracy of 0.24 W m-2, an error of less than 5\%. The speed of execution of RRTM compares favorably with that of other rapid radiation models, indicating that the model is suitable for use in general circulation models.}

  abstract = {Abstract Ground-based observations of ice particle size distribution and ensemble mean density are used to quantify the effect of riming on snowfall. The rime mass fraction is derived from these measurements by following the approach that is used in a single ice-phase category microphysical scheme proposed for the use in numerical weather prediction models. One of the characteristics of the proposed scheme is that the prefactor of a power law relation that links mass and size of ice particles is determined by the rime mass fraction, while the exponent does not change. To derive the rime mass fraction, a mass-dimensional relation representative of unrimed snow is also determined. To check the validity of the proposed retrieval method, the derived rime mass fraction is converted to the effective liquid water path that is compared to microwave radiometer observations. Since dual-polarization radar observations are often used to detect riming, the impact of riming on dual-polarization radar variables is studied for differential reflectivity measurements. It is shown that the relation between rime mass fraction and differential reflectivity is ambiguous, other factors such as change in median volume diameter need also be considered. Given the current interest on sensitivity of precipitation to aerosol pollution, which could inhibit riming, the importance of riming for surface snow accumulation is investigated. It is found that riming is responsible for 5\% to 40\% of snowfall mass. The study is based on data collected at the University of Helsinki field station in Hyyti\"al\"a during U.S. Department of Energy Biogenic Aerosols Effects on Clouds and Climate (BAECC) field campaign and the winter 2014/2015. In total 22 winter storms were analyzed, and detailed analysis of two events is presented to illustrate the study.},

The precipitation intensity in these localized areas was 6-14 times higher than the background large-scale precipitation rate.

There appears to be an increase in the ice particle number concentration within the intensification region. The observed events were linked to arriving or departing air traffic.

  abstract = {he Arctic region is particularly sensitive to climate change. Mixed-phase clouds, comprising both ice and supercooled liquid water, have a large impact on radiative fluxes in the Arctic. These clouds occur frequently during all seasons in the region, where they often persist for many days at a time. This persistence is remarkable given the inherent instability of ice\textendash liquid mixtures. In recent years it has emerged that feedbacks between numerous local processes, including the formation and growth of ice and cloud droplets, radiative cooling, turbulence, entrainment and surface fluxes of heat and moisture, interact to create a resilient mixed-phase cloud system. As well as the persistent mixed-phase cloud state there is another distinct Arctic state, characterized by radiatively clear conditions. The occurrence of either state seems to be related, in part, to large-scale environmental conditions. We suggest that shifts in the large-scale environment could alter the prevalence of mixed-phase clouds, potentially affecting surface radiative fluxes and the Arctic energy budget.},

  abstract = {A method for the parameterization of ice-phase microphysics is proposed and used to develop a new bulk microphysics scheme. All ice-phase particles are represented by several physical properties that evolve freely in time and space. The scheme prognoses four ice mixing ratio variables, total mass, rime mass, rime volume, and number, allowing 4 degrees of freedom for representing the particle properties using a single category. This approach represents a significant departure from traditional microphysics schemes in which ice-phase hydrometeors are partitioned into various predefined categories (e.g., cloud ice, snow, and graupel) with prescribed characteristics. The liquid-phase component of the new scheme uses a standard two-moment, two-category approach. The proposed method and a complete description of the new predicted particle properties (P3) scheme are provided. Results from idealized model simulations of a two-dimensional squall line are presented that illustrate overall behavior of the scheme. Despite its use of a single ice-phase category, the scheme simulates a realistically wide range of particle characteristics in different regions of the squall line, consistent with observed ice particles in real squall lines. Sensitivity tests show that both the prediction of the rime mass fraction and the rime density are important for the simulation of the squall-line structure and precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the atmosphere, microphysics refers to the microscale processes that affect cloud and precipitation particles and is a key linkage among the various components of Earth's atmospheric water and energy cycles. The representation of microphysical processes in models continues to pose a major challenge leading to uncertainty in numerical weather forecasts and climate simulations. In this paper, the problem of treating microphysics in models is divided into two parts: (i) how to represent the population of cloud and precipitation particles, given the impossibility of simulating all particles individually within a cloud, and (ii) uncertainties in the microphysical process rates owing to fundamental gaps in knowledge of cloud physics. The recently developed Lagrangian particle-based method is advocated as a way to address several conceptual and practical challenges of representing particle populations using traditional bulk and bin microphysics parameterization schemes. For addressing critical gaps in cloud physics knowledge, sustained investment for observational advances from laboratory experiments, new probe development, and next-generation instruments in space is needed. Greater emphasis on laboratory work, which has apparently declined over the past several decades relative to other areas of cloud physics research, is argued to be an essential ingredient for improving process-level understanding. More systematic use of natural cloud and precipitation observations to constrain microphysics schemes is also advocated. Because it is generally difficult to quantify individual microphysical process rates from these observations directly, this presents an inverse problem that can be viewed from the standpoint of Bayesian statistics. Following this idea, a probabilistic framework is proposed that combines elements from statistical and physical modeling. Besides providing rigorous constraint of schemes, there is an added benefit of quantifying uncertainty systematically. Finally, a broader hierarchical approach is proposed to accelerate improvements in microphysics schemes, leveraging the advances described in this paper related to process modeling (using Lagrangian particle-based schemes), laboratory experimentation, cloud and precipitation observations, and statistical methods.},

Using this method, an automatic determination of the degree of riming at any height above the melting layer is possible. The quantitative statement of snow crystal riming with a limited uncertainty is obtained by a strict separation of stratiform and convective precipitation. For stratiform precipitation, the uncertainty of the degree of riming determined by this remote sensing technique typically remains below one unit on a six step riming scale with somewhat larger uncertainties for very weak riming. A criterion is given for when the situation is stratiform enough to use the proposed method for determining the degree of snow crystal riming. This method is usefull in all studies where direct crystal observation is not possible and the degree of riming is needed with good time resolution over a longer time period and in different altitudes.},

The algorithm exploits a statistical relation that maps measurements of the differential Doppler velocities at X and Ka and at Ka and W bands into the two aforementioned DSD moments. The statistical mapping has been founded on 7,900 hr of disdrometer-observed DSDs and their simulated Doppler velocities. Additionally, a retrieval of based only on measurements is also presented, and its performance is compared to the analogous algorithm exploiting data. The retrievals are tested using triple-frequency radar data collected during a recent field campaign held at the Juelich Observatory for Cloud Evolution (JOYCE, Germany) where in situ measurements of the DSD were carried out only few meters away from the vertically pointing radars. The triple-frequency retrieval is able to obtain with an uncertainty below 25\% for ranging from 0.7 to 2.4 mm. Compared to previously published dual-frequency retrievals, the third frequency does not improve the retrieval for small ( mm). However, it significantly surpasses the algorithm for larger (20\% versus 50\% bias at 2.25 mm). Also compared to method, the triple-frequency retrieval is found to provide an improvement of 15\% in terms of bias for mm. The triple-frequency retrieval of performs with an uncertainty of 20\textendash 50\% for mm, with the best performance for mm.},

The atmospheric state classification is informed about the large-scale meteorology and state of cloudiness at the ARM SGP site by combining ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis data with 14 years of continuous observations from the millimeter-wavelength cloud radar. Almost half of the cirrus cloud occurrences in the vicinity of the ARM SGP site during SPARTICUS can be explained by three distinct synoptic conditions, namely, upper level ridges, midlatitude cyclones with frontal systems, and subtropical flows. Probability density functions (PDFs) of cirrus microphysical properties such as particle size distributions (PSDs), ice number concentrations, and ice water content (IWC) are examined and exhibit striking differences among the different synoptic regimes. Generally, narrower PSDs with lower IWC but higher ice number concentrations are found in cirrus sampled in upper level ridges, whereas cirrus sampled in subtropical flows, fronts, and aged anvils show broader PSDs with considerably lower ice number concentrations but higher IWC. Despite striking contrasts in the cirrus microphysics for different large-scale environments, the PDFs of vertical velocity are not different, suggesting that vertical velocity PDFs are a poor predictor for explaining the microphysical variability in cirrus. Instead, cirrus microphysical contrasts may be driven by differences in ice supersaturations or aerosols.},

Two cases of midlatitude anvil cirrus forming under very similar environmental conditions are examined. The case studies benefit from simultaneous observations of vertical velocities in cirrus collected at and around the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site during the U.S. Department of Energy Small Particles in Cirrus field campaign. Observations from both platforms suggest that the majority of vertical velocities in the examined midlatitude anvil cirrus cases are roughly within {$\pm$}1 m s-1 although higher vertical velocities are occasionally observed. The quality of the vertical velocity comparison between in situ aircraft measurements and ground-based Doppler radar retrievals depends on the case. For the first case on 23 April 2010, the comparison suggests that the radar retrieval may underestimate vertical velocities in the range between roughly 50 cm s-1 and 1 m s-1. For the second case on 14 June 2010, the agreement between radar and aircraft is excellent, and the differences are largely within the observed variability of vertical velocities within cirrus. Differences in the spatial scales of vertical velocities and turbulence sampled by the aircraft and Doppler radar, which arise due to differences in the temporal resolution of the observational platforms are not found to explain the observed discrepancies. Estimates for the dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy agree to within 1 order of magnitude between the two observational platforms.},

Like precipitation rate, precipitation frequency is dominated by warm rain, defined as rain produced via the liquid phase only, over the tropical oceans outside the Intertropical Convergence Zone and by cold rain, produced via the ice phase, over the midlatitude oceans and continents. Warm rain is very infrequent over the continents, with significant warm rain found only in onshore flow in the tropics, and over India, China, and Indochina. Comparison of the properties of precipitating and nonprecipitating warm clouds shows that the scarcity of warm rain over land can be explained by smaller effective radii in continental clouds that delay the onset of precipitation. The results highlight the importance of ice-phase processes for the global hydrological cycle and may lead to an improved parameterization of precipitation in general circulation models.},

By using both the HH and the HV channels instead of single co-polarised observations the algorithm is able to classify more leads correctly. The lead classification algorithm is based on polarimetric features and textural features derived from the grey-level co-occurrence matrix. The Random Forest classifier is used to investigate the importance of the individual features for lead detection. The precision?recall curve representing the quality of the classification is used to define threshold for a binary lead/sea ice classification.

The characterization is based on measured and modeled elevation dependencies of the polarimetric parameters differential reflectivity and correlation coefficient. The polarimetric data are obtained using a newly developed 35 GHz cloud radar MIRA-35 with hybrid polarimetric configuration and scanning capabilities. The full procedure chain of the technical implementation and the realization of the setup of the hybrid-mode cloud radar for the shape determination are presented. This includes the description of phase adjustments in the transmitting paths, the introduction of the general data processing scheme, correction of the data for the differences of amplifications and electrical path lengths in the transmitting and receiving channels, the rotation of the polarization basis by 45\textdegree, the correction of antenna effects on polarimetric measurements, the determination of spectral polarimetric variables, and the formulation of a scheme to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Modeling of the polarimetric variables is based on existing back-scattering models assuming the spheroidal representation of cloud scatterers. The parameters retrieved from the model are polarizability ratio and degree of orientation, which can be assigned to certain particle orientations and shapes. The developed algorithm is applied to a measurement of the hybrid-mode cloud radar taken on 20 October 2014 in Cabauw, the Netherlands, in the framework of the ACCEPT (Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques) campaign. The case study shows the retrieved polarizability ratio and degree of orientation of ice particles for a cloud system of three cloud layers at different heights. Retrieved polarizability ratios are 0.43, 0.85, and 1.5 which correspond to oblate, quasi-spherical, and columnar ice particles, respectively. It is shown that the polarizability ratio is useful for the detection of aggregation/riming processes. The orientation of oblate and prolate particles is estimated to be close to horizontal while quasi-spherical particles were found to be more randomly oriented.},

  abstract = {This study presents two methods for evaluating the reflectivity calibration of W-band cloud radars. Both methods use natural rain as a reference target. The first approach is based on a self-consistency method of polarimetric radar variables, which is widely used in the precipitation radar community. As previous studies pointed out, the method cannot be directly applied to higher frequencies where nonRayleigh scattering effects and attenuation have a nonnegligible influence on radar variables. The method presented here solves this problem by using polarimetric Doppler spectra to separate backscattering and propagational effects. New fits between the separated radar variables allow one to estimate the absolute radar calibration using a minimization technique. The main advantage of the self-consistency method is its lower dependence on the spatial variability in radar drop size distribution (DSD). The estimated uncertainty of the method is {$\pm$}0.7 dB. The method was applied to three intense precipitation events, and the retrieved reflectivity offsets were within the estimated uncertainty range. The second method is an improvement on the conventional disdrometerbased approach, where reflectivity from the lowest range gate is compared to simulated reflectivity using surface disdrometer observations. The improved method corrects, first, for the time lag between surface DSD observations and the radar measurements at a certain range. In addition, the effect of evaporation of raindrops on their way towards the surface is mitigated. The disdrometer-based method was applied to 12 rain events observed by vertically pointed W-band radar and showed repeatable estimates of the reflectivity offsets at rain rates below 4 mm h-1 within {$\pm$}0.9 dB. The proposed approaches can analogously be extended to Ka-band radars. Although very different in terms of complexity, both methods extend existing radar calibration evaluation approaches, which are inevitably needed for the growing cloud radar networks in order to provide high-quality radar observation to the atmospheric community.},

  abstract = {Accurate and precise characterization of cirrus cloud geometrical and optical properties is essential for better constraining their radiative footprint. A lidar-based retrieval scheme is proposed here, with its performance assessed on fine spatio-temporal observations over the Arctic site of Ny-\AA lesund, Svalbard. Two contributions related to cirrus geometrical (dynamic Wavelet Covariance Transform (WCT)) and optical properties (constrained Klett) are reported. The dynamic WCT rendered cirrus detection more robust, especially for thin cirrus layers that frequently remained undetected by the classical WCT method. Regarding optical characterization, we developed an iterative scheme for determining the cirrus lidar ratio (LRci) that is a crucial parameter for aerosol - cloud discrimination. Building upon the Klett-Fernald method, the LRci was constrained by an additional reference value. In established methods, such as the double-ended Klett, an aerosol-free reference value is applied. In the proposed constrained Klett, however, the reference value was approximated from cloud-free or low cloud optical depth (COD up to 0.2) profiles and proved to agree with independent Raman estimates. For optically thin cirrus, the constrained Klett inherent uncertainties reached 50\% (60-74\%) in terms of COD (LRci). However, for opaque cirrus COD (LRci) uncertainties were lower than 10\% (15\%). The detection method discrepancies (dynamic versus static WCT) had a higher impact on the optical properties of low COD layers (up to 90\%) compared to optically thicker ones (less than 10\%). The constrained Klett presented high agreement with two established retrievals. For an exemplary cirrus cloud, the constrained Klett estimated the COD355 ({$\mathsl{L}\mathsl{R}$}355{$\mathsl{c}\mathsl{i}$}) at 0.28 {$\pm$} 0.17 (29 {$\pm$} 4 sr), the double-ended Klett at 0.27 {$\pm$} 0.15 (32 {$\pm$} 4 sr) and the Raman retrievals at 0.22 {$\pm$} 0.12 (26 {$\pm$} 11 sr). Our approach to determine the necessary reference value can also be applied in established methods and increase their accuracy. In contrast, the classical aerosol-free assumption led to 44 sr LRci overestimation in optically thin layers and 2-8 sr in thicker ones. The multiple scattering effect was corrected using Eloranta (1998) and accounted for 50-60\% extinction underestimation near the cloud base and 20-30\% within the cirrus layers.},

Active lidar and radar instruments on board CALIPSO and CloudSat allow the vertical distribution of clouds and their optical properties to be studied on a global scale. To evaluate the clouds modeled by ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat, the lidar and radar satellite simulators of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project's Observation Simulator Package are used. Comparison of ECHAM5 with CALIPSO and CloudSat found large-scale features resolved by the model, such as the Hadley circulation, are captured well. The lidar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the amount of high-level clouds, particularly optically thin clouds. High-altitude clouds in ECHAM5 consistently produced greater lidar scattering ratios compared with CALIPSO. Consequently, the lidar signal in ECHAM5 frequently attenuated high in the atmosphere. The large scattering ratios were due to an underestimation of effective ice crystal radii in ECHAM5. Doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the scattering ratios and frequency of attenuation. Additionally, doubling the effective ice crystal radii improved the detection of ECHAM5's highest-level clouds by the radar simulator, in better agreement with CloudSat. ECHAM5 was also shown to significantly underestimate midlevel clouds and (sub)tropical low-level clouds. The low-level clouds produced were consistently perceived by the lidar simulator as too optically thick. The radar simulator demonstrated ECHAM5 overestimates the frequency of precipitation, yet underestimates its intensity compared with CloudSat observations. These findings imply compensating mechanisms in ECHAM5 balance out the radiative imbalance caused by incorrect optical properties of clouds and consistently large hydrometeors in the atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow, long, transient, water vapor-rich corridors of the atmosphere that are responsible for over 90\% of the poleward water vapor transport in and across midlatitudes. However, the role of ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate features (e.g., water vapor content and precipitation) has not been fully studied, even though moistening of the polar atmosphere is both a key result and amplifier of Arctic warming and sea ice melt, and precipitation is key to the surface mass balance of polar sea ice and ice sheets. This study uses the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 reanalysis to characterize the roles of AR water vapor transport on the column-integrated atmospheric water vapor budget in the extratropical and polar regions of both hemispheres. Meridional water vapor transport by ARs across a given latitude (examined for 40\textdegree, 50\textdegree, 60\textdegree, and 70\textdegree ) is strongly related to variations in area-averaged (i.e., over the cap poleward of the given latitude) total water vapor storage and precipitation poleward of that latitude. For the climatological annual cycle, both AR transport (i.e., nonlocal sources) and total evaporation (i.e., local sources) are most correlated with total precipitation, although with slightly different phases. However, for monthly anomalies, the water budget at higher latitudes is largely dominated by the relationship between AR transport and precipitation. For pentad and daily anomalies, AR transport is related to both precipitation and water vapor storage variations. These results demonstrate the important role of episodic, extreme water vapor transports by ARs in modulating extratropical and polar hydroclimate.},

This study re-examines simple models for the effects due to finite beam-width and vertical shear of the horizontal wind. Analytic solutions of 1- and 2-dimensional models are presented. Comparisons of the simple 2-dimensional model with numerical integrations of a 3-dimensional model with a symmetrical Gaussian beam show that the 2-dimensional model is usually adequate. The solution of the 2-dimensional model gives a formula that can be applied easily to large data sets. Analysis of the analytic solutions of the 2-dimensional model for off-vertical beams reveals a term that has not been included in mathematical formulas for spectral broadening in the past. This term arises from the simultaneous effects of the changing geometry due to curvature within a finite beamwidth and the vertical wind shear. The magnitude of this effect can be comparable to that of the well-known effects of beam-broadening and wind shear, and since it can have either algebraic sign, it can significantly reduce (or increase) the expected spectral broadening, although under typical conditions it is smaller than the beam-broadening effect. The predictions of this simple model are found to be consistent with observations from the VHP radar at White Sands Missile Range, NM.},

  abstract = {Focusing on conditions of subsidence when low clouds are present, ground-based observations in both the North Atlantic and the Southern Ocean reveal strong relationships between cloud boundary (base and top heights) and different measures of lower tropospheric instability. The difference in potential temperature between the surface and 800 hPa (a metric called M) provides a stronger relationship than measures of inversion strength such as the lower tropospheric stability and estimated inversion strength. This is because (1) inversion strength itself does not correlate well with cloud boundaries, and (2) M contains information that appears important for cloud boundaries. These include the surface forcing through the use of sea surface rather than near-surface air temperature and an upper level close to the real cloud top. These results expand upon previous work on the importance of M as a predictor of cloud morphology. However, important differences are found in low-cloud conditions for the North Atlantic as compared to the Southern Ocean (for a given value of M): stronger inversions, deeper boundary layers, and much larger sea level pressures. Therefore, the relationship between cloud boundaries and M differs between the two regions. A general circulation model provides similar relationships as observed between M and both cloud top height and temperature but tends to place clouds higher and at colder temperatures than observed for a given M. This might cause issues with the representation of precipitation, cloud cover and radiation in the Southern Ocean.},

Symmetry of geophysical media encountered in remote sensing due to reflection, rotation, azimuthal, and centrical symmetry groups is considered for both reciprocal and nonreciprocal cases. On the basis of the invariance under symmetry transformations in the linear polarization basis, the scattering coefficients are related by a set of equations which restrict the number of independent parameters in the polarimetric covariance matrix. The properties derived under these transformations are general and apply to all scattering mechanisms in a given symmetrical configuration. The scattering coefficients calculated from theoretical models for layer random media and rough surfaces are shown to obey the derived symmetry relations. Use of symmetry properties in remote sensing of structural and environmental responses of scattering media is discussed. As a practical application, the results from this paper provide new methods for the external calibration of polarimetric radars without the deployment of man-made calibration targets.},

The angular width of the local maximum is shown to contain information on the particle maximum deviation angle, while the maximum intensity can provide information on particle shape and relative concentrations of ice crystals, horizontally and randomly oriented. The study of 31 ice cloud cases show that in 80\% of them, the deviation angle is less than 3\textdegree. Also, the relative concentration of horizontally oriented crystals is less than 21\%, depending on the angular distribution used for crystal deviation.},

In this study, a 9-year record of aerosol, cloud and atmospheric state properties is used to quantify aerosol in?uence on ice production in mixed-phase clouds. It is found that mixedphase clouds present in a clean aerosol state have higher ice water content (IWC) by a factor of 1.22 to 1.63 at cloud base than do similar clouds in cases with higher aerosol loading. We additionally analyze radar-derived mean Doppler velocities to better understand the drivers behind this relationship, and we conclude that aerosol induced reduction of the ice crystal nucleation rate, together with decreased riming rates in polluted clouds, are likely in?uences on the observed reductions in IWC.},

Using two years of observations from a remote-sensing site located on the east coast of Barbados, the vertical distribution of cloud and its contribution to low-level cloud amount are explored. The vertical distribution of first-detected cloud-base heights is marked by a strong peak near the lifting condensation level (LCL) from passive optically thin shallow cumuli. Cloud with a base near this level dominates the total cloud cover with a contribution of about two-thirds. The other one-third comes from cloud with its cloud base further aloft at heights {$>$} 1 km, such as cumulus edges or stratiform cloud below the trade inversion. Cloud found aloft, regardless of where its base is located, contains more variance, in particular near the inversion and on time-scales longer than a day. In turn, cloud near the LCL is surprisingly invariant on longer time-scales, although consistent with existing theories. Because this component does not systematically vary, changes in cloud cover in response to changes in meteorology or climate may be limited to changes in its contribution from cloud aloft.},

  abstract = {Stratocumulus is one of the most common cloud types globally, with a profound effect on the earth's radiation budget, and the drizzle process is fundamental in understanding the evolution of these boundary layer clouds. In this paper a combination of 94-GHz Doppler radar and backscatter lidar is used to investigate the microphysical properties of drizzle falling below the base of stratocumulus clouds. The ratio of the radar to lidar backscatter power is proportional to the fourth power of mean size, and so potentially it can provide an accurate size estimate. Information about the shape of the drop size distribution is then inferred from the Doppler spectral width. The algorithm estimates vertical profiles of drizzle parameters such as liquid water content, liquid water flux, and vertical air velocity, assuming that the drizzle size spectrum may be represented by a gamma distribution. The depletion time scale of cloud liquid water through the drizzle process can be estimated when the liquid water path of the cloud is available from microwave radiometers, and observations suggest that this time scale varies from a few days in light drizzle to a few hours in strong drizzle events. Radar and lidar observations from Chilbolton (in southern England) and aircraft size spectra taken during the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment have both been used to derive the following power-law relationship between liquid water flux (LWF) (g m-2 s-1) and radar reflectivity (Z) (mm6 m-3): LWF = 0.0093Z0.69. This relation is valid for frequencies up to 94 GHz and therefore would allow a forthcoming spaceborne radar to measure liquid water flux around the globe to within a factor of 2 for values of Z above -20 dBZ.},

Winter variability and change occur in the seasonally ice-covered seas farther south: the Barents Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Greenland Sea, and Baffin Bay, with the Barents Sea carrying the largest fraction of loss in March (27\%). The distinct regions of summer and winter sea ice variability and loss have generally been consistent since 1950, but appear at present to be in transformation as a result of the rapid ice loss in all seasons. As regions become seasonally ice free, future ice loss will be dominated by winter. The Kara Sea appears as the first currently perennial ice-covered sea to become ice free in September. Remaining on currently observed trends, the Arctic shelf seas are estimated to become seasonally ice free in the 2020s, and the seasonally ice-covered seas farther south to become ice free year-round from the 2050s.},

In this study, we use a two-months X, Ka, W-Band Doppler radar dataset of mid-latitude winter clouds to infer statistical growth signatures of ice and snow particles. The observational statistics are compared to forward simulated radar moments based on simulations of the campaign time period with a high-resolution version of the ICON model and a two-moment microphysical scheme. The statistical comparison shows very good agreement of the simulated vertical structure of radar reflectivity and surface precipitation rate. The dual-wavelength ratios, which are closely related to the mean particle size, also show consistently a major increase at temperatures larger than -15{$\bigcirc$}C. However, at temperatures larger than -7{$\bigcirc$}C, ICON increasingly overestimates the mean particle size. The statistics of mean Doppler velocities also reveals that the model overestimates the terminal velocity of snow particles, especially at larger sizes. We discuss possible reasons for the identified discrepancies, such as an unrealistic temperature dependence of the sticking efficiency or the non-saturation of terminal velocities at larger sizes caused by the implemented power-law relations. Our study exemplary demonstrates the importance of combining various radar techniques for identifying issues in simulated microphysical processes, which can otherwise be hidden due to compensating errors.},

The method is applicable to uniform, stratified clouds and is applied here to cirrus clouds. A unique aspect of the technique consists of partitioning the Doppler velocities into discrete cloud height and cloud reflectivity bins prior to temporal averaging. The first step of the method is to temporally average the partitioned Doppler velocities over an hour or two to remove the effects of small-scale vertical air motions. This establishes relationships between particle fall velocity and radar reflectivity at various levels within the cloud. Comparisons with aircraft in situ observations from other experiments show consistency with the remote-sensing observations. These results suggest that particle fall speeds can be determined to within 5\textendash 10 cm s-1 by means of this technique.},

This study illustrates a new approach to qualitative and quantitative analysis of the complexity of ice and mixed-phase microphysical processes in Arctic deep precipitating systems using the combination of Ka-band zenith-pointing radar Doppler spectra and quasi-vertical profiles of polarimetric radar variables measured by a Ka/W-band scanning radar. The results illustrate the frequent occurrence of multimodal Doppler spectra in the dendritic/planar growth layer, where locally generated, slower-falling particle populations are well separated from faster-falling populations in terms of Doppler velocity. The slower-falling particle populations contribute to an increase of differential reflectivity (ZDR), while an enhanced specific differential phase (KDP) in this dendritic growth temperature range is caused by both the slower and faster-falling particle populations. Another area with frequent occurrence of multimodal Doppler spectra is in mixed-phase layers, where both populations produce ZDR and KDP values close to 0, suggesting the occurrence of a riming process. Joint analysis of the Doppler spectra and the polarimetric radar variables provides important insight into the microphysics of snow formation and allows the separation of the contributions of ice of different habits to the values of reflectivity and ZDR.},

First, the Arctic is already changing rapidly as a result of climate change. Contemporary warm Arctic temperatures and large sea ice deficits (75\% volume loss) demonstrate climate states outside of previous experience. Modeled changes of the Arctic cryosphere demonstrate that even limiting global temperature increases to near 2 \textdegree C will leave the Arctic a much different environment by mid-century with less snow and sea ice, melted permafrost, altered ecosystems, and a projected annual mean Arctic temperature increase of +4 \textdegree C. Second, even under ambitious emission reduction scenarios, high-latitude land ice melt, including Greenland, are foreseen to continue due to internal lags, leading to accelerating global sea level rise throughout the century. Third, future Arctic changes may in turn impact lower latitudes through tundra greenhouse gas release and shifts in ocean and atmospheric circulation. Arctic-specific radiative and heat storage feedbacks may become an obstacle to achieving a stabilized global climate. In light of these trends, the precautionary principle calls for early adaptation and mitigation actions.},

We find an anticorrelation between sea ice extent and cloud fraction with maximum cloudiness occurring over areas with little or no sea ice. We also find that over ice?free regions, there is greater low cloud frequency and average optical depth. Most of the optical depth increase is due to the presence of geometrically thicker clouds over water. In addition, our analysis indicates that over the last 5 years, October and March average polar cloud fraction has increased by about 7 \% and 10 \%, respectively, as year average sea ice extent has decreased by 5 \%?7 \%. The observed cloud changes are likely due to a number of effects including, but not limited to, the observed decrease in sea ice extent and thickness. Increasing cloud amount and changes in vertical distribution and optical properties have the potential to affect the radiative balance of the Arctic region by decreasing both the upwelling terrestrial longwave radiation and the downward shortwave solar radiation. Because longwave radiation dominates in the long polar winter, the overall effect of increasing low cloud cover is likely a warming of the Arctic and thus a positive climate feedback, possibly accelerating the melting of Arctic sea ice.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of the albedo of the sea surface for shortwave solar radiation has been carried out on a fixed platform. Fifteen-minute totals of upward and downward irradiances were recorded continuously for four months over a wide range of atmospheric and sea conditions. The resulting albedo values, the ratio of upward to downward irradiance, are expressed in terms of a particularly convenient pair of parameters, sun altitude and atmospheric transmittance (T). The latter is defined as the ratio of observed downward irradiance to the irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and has not been used before in describing albedo. Examples of albedo values are 0.061{$\pm$}0.005 for heavily overcast skies (0.0{$<$}T{$\leq$}0.1), indicating isotropic radiance distribution, and a range for clear skies (T{$>$}0.65) of 0.03 for high sun to as large as 0.45 at sun altitudes {$<$}10\textdegree. The uncertainty in the values is less than 7\% for sun altitudes {$>$}25\textdegree{} and increases to 25\% for very low sun attitudes. The effect of wind, through surface roughness, is shown to be small but predictable. Effects of whitecaps are not noticeable at wind speeds up to 30 kt, the highest observed in the study. Application of the results is made to climatological studies of the absorption of solar energy by the surface waters of the ocean. Monthly average albedos, are calculated for the Atlantic Ocean to compare with Budyko's latitudinally dependent values, and it is shown that although the sets of results agree within 10\% at latitudes up to 40\textdegree, there are discrepancies at higher latitudes as high as 100\%. Finally it is shown with climatological albedo values calculated from the results of this study, that the accuracy of climatological estimates of solar energy absorbed in the ocean are now limited by the accuracy of climatological estimates of downward irradiance.},

However, to retrieve accurate estimates of snow mass and rate, these observations require augmentation through additional information and assumptions about hydrometeor properties. The Precipitation Imaging Package (PIP) provides information about precipitation characteristics and can be utilized to improve estimates of snowfall rate and accumulation. Here, the goal is to demonstrate the quality and utility of two higher-order PIP-derived products: liquid water equivalent snow rate and an approximation of volume-weighted density called equivalent density. Accuracy of the PIP snow rate and equivalent density is obtained through intercomparison with established retrieval methods and through evaluation with colocated ground-based observations. The results confirm the ability of the PIP-derived products to quantify properties of snow rate and equivalent density, and demonstrate that the PIP produces physically realistic snow characteristics. When compared to the National Weather Service (NWS) snow field measurements of six-hourly accumulation, the PIP-derived accumulations were biased only +2.48\% higher. Additionally, this work illustrates fundamentally different microphysical and bulk features of low and high snow-to-liquid ratio events, through assessment of observed particle size distributions, retrieved mass coefficients, and bulk properties. Importantly, this research establishes the role that PIP observations and higher-order products can serve for constraining microphysical assumptions in ground-based and spaceborne remotely sensed snowfall retrievals.},

However, such processes are still not clearly understood although they are important processes for precipitation formation in midlatitudes. To better understand how ice particles grow within such clouds, changes in the microphysical parameters of a particle population falling through the cloud have to be analyzed. The Transportable Atmospheric Radar (TARA) can retrieve the full 3D Doppler velocity vector based on a unique three-beam configuration. Using the derived wind information, a new fall streak retrieval technique is proposed so that microphysical changes along those streaks can be studied. The method is based on Doppler measurements only. The shown examples measured during the Analysis of the Composition of Clouds with Extended Polarization Techniques (ACCEPT) campaign demonstrate that the retrieval is able to capture the fall streaks within different cloud systems. These fall streaks can be used to study changes in a single particle population from its generation (at cloud top) until its disintegration. In this study fall streaks are analyzed using radar moments or Doppler spectra. Synergetic measurements with other instruments during ACCEPT allow the detection of liquid layers within the clouds. The estimated microphysical information is used here to get a better understanding of the influence of supercooled liquid layers on ice crystal growth. This technique offers a new perspective for cloud microphysical studies.},

  abstract = {Climate change alters ecosystems and their functioning, but biodiversity can buffer such changes. Previous syntheses suggest that biodiversity confers insurance; however, it is not clear whether this effect extends to climatic stressors. Here, we analyze 342 measures of the effects of biodiversity on stability in order to compare the response to climatic versus nonclimatic stressors. In general, the stabilizing effect of biodiversity is weaker for climatic than for nonclimatic stressors. We suggest that this reflects species pools being compiled at a small spatial scale for experiments testing climatic stressors. Some bias in the representation of biomes and stability metrics in biodiversity\textendash climate studies may also distort the perceived effect of biodiversity on stability. We recommend that in future studies, researchers increase the spatial scale of experiments, manipulate multiple facets of biodiversity, simulate climate change in more realistic ways, and focus on underrepresented combinations of biomes and climatic stressors.},

Arctic amplification has been found in past warm and glacial periods, as well as in historical observations and climate model experiments. Feedback effects associated with temperature, water vapour and clouds have been suggested to contribute to amplified warming in the Arctic, but the surface albedo feedback\textemdash the increase in surface absorption of solar radiation when snow and ice retreat\textemdash is often cited as the main contributor. However, Arctic amplification is also found in models without changes in snow and ice cover. Here we analyse climate model simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive to quantify the contributions of the various feedbacks. We find that in the simulations, the largest contribution to Arctic amplification comes from a temperature feedbacks: as the surface warms, more energy is radiated back to space in low latitudes, compared with the Arctic. This effect can be attributed to both the different vertical structure of the warming in high and low latitudes, and a smaller increase in emitted blackbody radiation per unit warming at colder temperatures. We find that the surface albedo feedback is the second main contributor to Arctic amplification and that other contributions are substantially smaller or even opposeArctic amplification.},

  abstract = {Pulses of warm and moist air from lower latitudes provide energy to the Arctic and form its main energy source outside of the summer months. These pulses can cause substantial surface warming and trigger ice melt. Air-mass transport in the opposite direction, away from the Arctic, leads to cold-air outbreaks. The outbreaks are often associated with cold extremes over continents, and extreme surface heat fluxes and occasional polar lows over oceans. Air masses advected across the strong Arctic-tomid-latitude temperature gradient are rapidly transformed into colder and dryer or warmer and moister air masses by clouds, radiative and turbulent processes, particularly in the boundary layer. Phase changes from liquid to ice within boundary-layer clouds are critical in these air-mass transformations. The presence of liquid water determines the radiative effects of these clouds, whereas the presence of ice is crucial for subsequent cloud decay or dissipation, processes that are poorly represented in weather and climate models. We argue that a better understanding of how air masses are transformed on their way into and out of the Arctic is essential for improved prediction of weather and climate in the Arctic and mid-latitudes. Observational and modelling exercises should take an air-mass-following Lagrangian approach to attain these goals.},

Secondly, an analytic expression of the adiabatic liquid water content is derived and reveals that A depends exclusively upon the cloud base characteristics.

For each individual image, the method relies on the calculation of a set of geometric and texture-based descriptors to simultaneously identify the hydrometeor type (among six predefined classes), estimate the degree of riming and detect melting snow. The classification tasks are achieved by means of a regularized multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model trained over more than 3000 MASC images manually labeled by visual inspection. In a second step, the probabilistic information provided by the MLR is weighed on the three stereoscopic views of the MASC in order to assign a unique label to each hydrometeor. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on data collected in the Swiss Alps and in Antarctica. The algorithm achieves high performance, with a hydrometeor-type classification accuracy and Heidke skill score of 95\% and 0.93, respectively. The degree of riming is evaluated by introducing a riming index ranging between zero (no riming) and one (graupel) and characterized by a probable error of 5.5\%. A validation study is conducted through a comparison with an existing classification method based on two-dimensional video disdrometer (2DVD) data and shows that the two methods are consistent.},

In this paper, the radar equation for a meteorological target is derived, particular attention being devoted to the effect of the shape of the main lobe of the beam, and of the radiation outside it. It is shown that previous theoretical expressions for both the gain and the echoing volume have been too large, and hence that previous equations overestimated the received power.

  abstract = {Knowledge of water-drop and ice-crystal terminal velocities is particularly important for an adequate representation of particle sedimentation in cloud-resolving and large-scale models. In this paper, a new method is proposed to retrieve terminal fall velocity from airborne-Doppler-radar observations. To extract the terminal fall velocity from the Doppler information, which mixes the three wind components and the terminal fall velocity, statistical considerations are introduced, stating that for a long sampling time span (a whole aircraft mission, for instance) and for moderate storms such as stratiform precipitation, the mean vertical air motions should vanish with respect to the mean terminal fall velocity. Statistical power-law relationships between terminal fall speed and radar reflectivity are then developed, as well as profiles of mean terminal fall velocity. This underlying hypothesis of the method is validated with in situ measurements of the vertical wind component, averages of convective-scale retrievals of the vertical wind component, and terminal fall speed\textendash radar reflectivity (VT\textendash Z) relationships derived from in situ measurements of the drop size distribution. These comparisons all indicate that the vertical air motion can indeed be neglected with respect to the terminal fall speed. A detailed analysis of the statistical relationships obtained in liquid and ice phases for six frontal cyclones at different stages of development shows that a `universal' VT\textendash Z rain relationship can be proposed for North Atlantic frontal cyclones at mature stage. This result and further arguments developed in the paper suggest that the drop size distributions are `equilibrium' distributions. In the ice phase, such a `universal' relationship is not found. It is nevertheless suggested in this study that such a general relationship might be derived if the frontal cyclones are split into categories depending on their stage of development. These VT\textendash Z `universal' relationships can be introduced in large-scale model parametrization schemes in order to better describe the sedimentation of ice and water and dynamical\textendash microphysical interactions occurring within North Atlantic frontal cyclones. Finally, a procedure is proposed to estimate the most representative type of ice particle from 2D-P in situ sensor and airborne-Doppler-radar measurements. It consists of calculating the mean flight-level Z and the VT\textendash Z relationships in the ice phase for several theoretical ice habits, and to identify the ice habit that reasonably reproduces both the radar-derived mean flight-level Z and VT\textendash Z ice relationship.},

  abstract = {Doppler radar measurements at different frequencies (50 and 2835 MHz) are used to characterize the terminal fall speed of hydrometeors and the vertical air motion in tropical ice clouds and to evaluate statistical methods for retrieving these two parameters using a single vertically pointing cloud radar. For the observed vertical air motions, it is found that the mean vertical air velocity in ice clouds is small on average, as is assumed in terminal fall speed retrieval methods. The mean vertical air motions are slightly negative (downdraft) between the melting layer (5-km height) and 6.3-km height, and positive (updraft) above this altitude, with two peaks of 6 and 7 cm s-1 at 7.7- and 9.7-km height. For the retrieved hydrometeor terminal fall speeds, it is found that the variability of terminal fall speeds within narrow reflectivity ranges is typically within the acceptable uncertainties for using terminal fall speeds in ice cloud microphysical retrievals. This study also evaluates the performance of previously published statistical methods of separating terminal fall speed and vertical air velocity from vertically pointing Doppler radar measurements using the 50-/2835-MHz radar retrievals as a reference. It is found that the variability of the terminal fall speed\textendash radar reflectivity relationship (Vt\textendash Ze) is large in ice clouds and cannot be parameterized accurately with a single relationship. A well-defined linear relationship is found between the two coefficients of a power-law Vt\textendash Ze relationship, but a more accurate microphysical retrieval is obtained using Doppler velocity measurements to better constrain the Vt\textendash Ze relationship for each cloud. When comparing the different statistical methods to the reference, the distribution of terminal fall speed residual is wide, with most residuals being in the {$\pm$}30\textendash 40 cm s-1 range about the mean. The typical mean residual ranged from 15 to 20 cm s-1, with different methods having mean residuals of {$<$}10 cm s-1 at some heights, but not at the same heights for all methods. The so-called Vt\textendash Ze technique was the most accurate above 9-km height, and the running-mean technique outperformed the other techniques below 9-km height. Sensitivity tests of the running-mean technique indicate that the 20-min average is the best trade-off for the type of ice clouds considered in this analysis. A new technique is proposed that incorporates simple averages of Doppler velocity for each (Ze, H) couple in a given cloud. This technique, referred to as DOP\textendash Ze\textendash H, was found to outperform the three other methods at most heights, with a mean terminal fall residual of {$<$}10 cm s-1 at all heights. This error magnitude is compatible with the use of such retrieved terminal fall speeds for the retrieval of microphysical properties.},

AMC has an annual occurrence frequency of 42.3 \%, which includes 18.7 \% of single-layered AMCs and 23.6 \% for multiple layers. Two cloud base heights (CBHs) are de?ned from ceilometer and micropulse lidar (MPL) measurements. For single-layered AMC, the ceilometer-derived CBH represents the base of the liquid-dominant layer near the cloud top, while MPL-derived CBH represents base of the lower ice-dominant layer. The annual mean CBHs from ceilometer and MPL measurements are 1.0 km and 0.6 km, respectively, with the largest difference ( 1.0 km) occurring from December to March and the smallest difference in September. The humidity inversion occurrence decreases with increasing humidity inversion intensity (stronger in summer than in winter). During the winter months, AMC occurrences increase from 15 \% to 35 \% when the inversion intensity increases from 0.1 to 0.9 g/kg. On the contrary, despite a higher frequency of strong humidity inversion in summer, AMC occurrences are nearly invariant for different inversion intensities. On average, humidity and temperature inversion frequencies of occurrence above an AMC are 5 and 8 times, respectively, as high as those below an AMC. The strong inversion occurrences for both humidity and temperature above an AMC provide the moisture sources from above for the formation and maintenance of AMCs. This result helps to reconcile the persistency of AMCs even when the Arctic surface is covered by snow and ice.},

In September and October, AMC occurrence frequency is 20?30 \% lower during a southerly wind when compared to the other wind directions; in November, the variation of AMC occurrence frequency with wind direction is small. The mean liquid water path in November is about half of that in October and September. When the surface is snow free, temperature (T) and speci?c humidity (q) pro?les during a northerly wind are warmer and moister than those for the southerly wind. Northerly wind pro?les have a higher relative humidity to ice (RH i ) and lower atmosphere stability. Furthermore, the AMC occurrence frequency has a positive relationship with RH i and a negative relationship with stability. These two points may explain the lower AMC occurrence frequency during a southerly wind. During a northerly wind, AMCs have larger radar re?ectivity, wider spectrum width, and larger Doppler velocity signatures. The stronger precipitation for AMC during a northerly wind is possibly due to the cleaner air masses from the ocean (north). With the same amount of q, the radar spectrum width has a higher frequency in the larger bins during a northerly wind. Both T, q, and radar re?ectivity, radar spectrum width pro?les show evidence of deposition in the sub-cloud layer in September and October.},

  abstract = {This article describe cloud ice and precipitation process in 17 wintertime storm systems that occurred over the mountains of northwestern Colorado. Surface, remote sensing and aircraft measurements are used to study cloud and precipitation characteristics. Ice particle concentrations; secondary ice particle production; and ice panicle growth, habits and aggregation are studied in the context of cloud system structure. The region of the cloud near cloud top was found to be a primary source region for ice particles in these clouds. Ice particle concentrations were found to increase over elevated topography and to increase at lower altitudes in deep cloud systems. Approximately 80\% of the measured concentrations were within the range of 1-100 L-1, and 50\% were less than 20 L-1. The activity of three secondary ice particle production mechanisms was evaluated. Fragmentation was found to be important in cloud systems that contained dendritic crystals. Evidence suggested that the Hallett-Mossop rime splintering mechanism occurred only occasionally in these clouds and contributed little to the total precipitation. Droplet fragmentation during freezing did not appear to be an important mechanism. Surface precipitation from these cloud systems consisted of irregular crystal habits and dendritic snowfall. Irregular particles accounted for approximately 70\% of the snowfall. The large number of irregular particles was attributed to (a) continuous changes in vapor density excess, temperature and concentration of liquid water droplets encountered by particles during their fall; (b) fragmentation; and (c) riming. Dendrites accounted for approximately 20\% of the snowfall. A common feature of all but one major dendritic snowfall event was that cloud top was in or near the dendritic growth temperature regime (-13\textdegree{} to -17\textdegree C). Aircraft penetrations near the tops of these clouds found the cloud top region to contain liquid water. In these cases, the region near cloud top was found to have ideal conditions for dendritic growth. Warm temperature sheaths and needles contributed little to the total precipitation in these cloud systems.}

  abstract = {During the Smoke, Clouds, and Radiation-Brazil (SCAR-B) project, the microphysical properties of over 1000 warm, nonprecipitating, clouds were measured from the University of Washington research aircraft. The clouds were partially embedded in the continental-scale, smoky haze that envelops much of Brazil during the biomass-burning season. For the entire data set, the most universal parameterization for the effective cloud droplet radius (r(eff)) is as a function of the ratio of cloud liquid water content (LWC) to droplet concentration (essentially the volume mean radius, r(v)); this agrees with previous studies under less polluted conditions. Comparisons of SCAR-B data with data from the east coast of the United States and clean oceanic areas show that the r(eff)-r(v) relationship is similar in all three cases, suggesting that even the extreme case of clouds impacted by large biomass fires can be treated similarly to more typical clouds. Beyond a certain ambient concentration of accumulation-mode particles (similar to 3000-4000 cm(-3)), cloud drop number concentrations for cumulus clouds in Brazil were almost constant, so that further increases in the ambient particle concentration did not change r(eff), and r(eff) correlates well with LWC alone. For example, a cumulus cloud, which capped a particularly large smoke plume with total particle concentrations {$>$}150,000 cm(-3), had the same r(eff)-LWC relationship as other clouds in the region where the ambient particle concentrations were similar to 3000 cm(-3). In this study the values of r(eff) for cumulus clouds in Brazil affected by smoke were between 3 and 8 mu m, compared to 9 to 14 mu m inferred from satellite measurements of cloud reflectivity at 3.7 mu m by Kaufman and Fraser [1997].},

  abstract = {Knowledge of cloud phase (liquid, ice, mixed, etc.) is necessary to describe the radiative impact of clouds and their lifetimes, but is a property that is difficult to simulate correctly in climate models. One step towards improving those simulations is to make observations of cloud phase with sufficient accuracy to help constrain model representations of cloud processes. In this study, we outline a methodology using a basic Bayesian classifier to estimate the probabilities of cloud-phase class from Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) vertically pointing active remote sensors. The advantage of this method over previous ones is that it provides uncertainty information on the phase classification. We also test the value of including higher moments of the cloud radar Doppler spectrum than are traditionally used operationally. Using training data of known phase from the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (M-PACE) field campaign, we demonstrate a proof of concept for how the method can be used to train an algorithm that identifies ice, liquid, mixed phase, and snow. Over 95\% of data are identified correctly for pure ice and liquid cases used in this study. Mixed-phase and snow cases are more problematic to identify correctly. When lidar data are not available, including additional information from the Doppler spectrum provides substantial improvement to the algorithm. This is a first step towards an operational algorithm and can be expanded to include additional categories such as drizzle with additional training data.},

  abstract = {To understand the microphysical processes that impact diabatic heating and cloud lifetimes in convection, we need to characterize the spatial distribution of supercooled liquid water. To address this observational challenge, ground-based vertically pointing active sensors at the Darwin Atmospheric Radiation Measurement site are used to classify cloud phase within a deep convective cloud. The cloud cannot be fully observed by a lidar due to signal attenuation. Therefore, we developed an objective method for identifying hydrometeor classes, including mixed-phase conditions, using k-means clustering on parameters that describe the shape of the Doppler spectra from vertically pointing Ka-band cloud radar. This approach shows that multiple, overlapping mixed-phase layers exist within the cloud, rather than a single region of supercooled liquid. Diffusional growth calculations show that the conditions for the Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen process exist within one of these mixed-phase microstructures. Convective cloud observed containing multiple mixed-phase layers K-means clustering of moments of radar spectra identifies layers Conditions favorable for WBF process observed in convective cloud We use radar measurements to identify regions of a thick tropical cloud with both liquid droplets and ice crystals at temperatures colder than 0\textdegree C. The coexistence of liquid and ice in the cloud changes how ice crystals grow. Because falling ice crystals melt into rain when they reach warmer air, observing where liquid and ice coexist can help us improve our understanding of when and how much clouds will rain.},

For this reason, the definition and design of a low-cost microwave radiometer suitable for automatic, high-quality observations of liquid water path (LWP) were one objective of the BALTEX cloud liquid water network: CLIWA-NET. In the course of the project, it turned out that a full profiling radiometer with 14 channels can be produced at only about 30\% higher cost than a classical dual-channel IWV/LWP radiometer. The profiling capability allows simultaneous observations of LWP and the lower tropospheric (0\textendash 5 km) humidity and temperature profiles with a temporal resolution of less than 10 s and a vertical resolution from 100 m to 1 km in the planetary boundary layer depending on height and atmospheric conditions. The latter is possible due to an elevation scan capability and by the implementation of a new filter bank design. The radiometer has several additional sensors (temperature, humidity, pressure, rain detector and GPS) which guarantee, together with a flexible software package, the operational performance of the system with maintenance intervals of about every 3 months. The performance of the first prototype has been verified during a 3-week campaign at Cabauw, The Netherlands.},

  abstract = {Global processes of urban growth lead to severe environmental impacts such as temperature increase with an intensification of the urban heat island effect, and hydrological changes with far reaching consequences for plant growth and human health and well-being. Urban trees can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by providing ecosystem services such as carbon storage, shading, cooling by transpiration or reduction of rainwater runoff. The extent of each ecosystem service is closely linked with the tree species as well as with a tree's age, size, structure and vitality. To evaluate the ecosystem services of urban trees, the process-based growth model CityTree was developed which is able to estimate not only tree growth but also the species-specific ecosystem services including carbon storage, transpiration and runoff, shading, and cooling by transpiration. The model was parametrized for the species small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), robinia (Robinia pseudoacacia), plane (Platanus\texttimes acerifolia) and horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). The model validation for tree growth (stem diameter increment, coefficient of correlation=0.76) as well as for the water balance (transpiration, coefficient of correlation=0.92) seems plausible and realistic. Tree growth and ecosystem services were simulated and analyzed for Central European cities both under current climate conditions and for the future climate scenarios. The simulations revealed that urban trees can significantly improve the urban climate and mitigate climate change effects. The quantity of the improvements depends on tree species and tree size as well as on the specific site conditions. Such simulation scenarios can be a proper basis for planning options to mitigate urban climate changes in individual cities.},

  abstract = {Advances in remote sensing of sea ice over the past two decades have resulted in a wide variety of satellitederived sea ice thickness data products becoming publicly available. Selecting the most appropriate product is challenging given objectives range from incorporating satellite-derived thickness information in operational activities, including sea ice forecasting, routing of maritime traffic, and search and rescue, to climate change analysis, longer-term modeling, prediction, and future planning. Depending on the use case, selecting the most suitable satellite data product can depend on the region of interest, data latency, and whether the data are provided routinely, for example via a climate or maritime service provider. Here we examine a suite of current sea ice thickness data products, collating key details of primary interest to end users. We assess sea ice thickness observations derived from sensors onboard the CryoSat-2 (CS2), Advanced Very-High-Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites. We evaluate the satellite-only observations with independent ice draft and thickness measurements obtained from the Beaufort Gyre Exploration Project (BGEP) upward looking sonars (ULS) and Operation IceBridge, respectively. We find a number of key differences among data products, but find that products utilizing CS2-only measurements are reliable for sea ice between 0.5 m and 4 m. Among 20 those compare, a blended CS2-SMOS product was the most reliable for thin ice. Ice thickness distributions at the end of winter appeared realistic when compared with independent ice draft measurements, with the exception of those derived from AVHRR. We noticed disagreement among the products in mean thickness trends especially in the winters of 2012\textendash 2013 and 2016\textendash 2017. Regional comparisons reveal large differences in ice thickness between products, particularly in the Kara Sea, an area of considerable ship traffic.},

  abstract = {Using a 2-year data set of combined lidar and cloud radar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) and CloudSat satellites, the occurrence of tropical cirrus and deep convective clouds is studied. The cloud identification algorithm takes advantage of the ability of the radar to probe deep precipitating clouds and of the lidar to sample even subvisual cirrus clouds. Examined are the frequency of occurrence and the geographical distribution of these clouds, and their apparent interconnections. There is a strong apparent diurnal variability in tropical cirrus mainly over land, with significantly more cirrus detected at night compared to day, but no clear diurnal pattern in deep convective activity. CALIPSO daylight signal noise effects do not appear to be not responsible for the diurnal cirrus pattern, because high, thin tropopause transitional layer (TTL) cirrus do not show a clear diurnal effect. Stratifying the global results by estimated visible cloud optical depth {$\tau$}, we find that most of the planet's subvisual ({$\tau$} {$<$} {$\sim$}0.03) cirrus clouds occur in the tropics and are more frequent at night and over ocean; thin ({$\sim$}0.03 {$<$} {$\tau$} {$<$} {$\sim$}0.3) cirrus have their highest global frequencies over equatorial landmasses and in the west Pacific region, and are also more frequent at night but occur mainly over land; and opaque ({$\sim$}0.3 {$<$} {$\tau$} {$<$} {$\sim$}3.0) cirrus are spread globally and tend to occur during the day over ocean. Although it is unknown which of the several proposed cirrus cloud formation mechanisms are key in the tropics, the close association of cirrus with convective clouds implies that tropical cirrus are linked to deep convective activity, with the likely exception of TTL cirrus clouds.},

The sensitivity of the retrieval method with respect to surface albedo, effective radius (reff), cloud height and ice crystal shape is quantified. An enhanced sensitivity of the retrieved {$\tau$}ci is found with respect to the surface albedo (up to 30\%) and ice crystal shape (up to 90\%).

This two-part paper describes the development of the SPeedy Algorithm for Radiative TrAnsfer through CloUd Sides (SPARTACUS) to capture these effects efficiently in a two-stream radiation scheme for use in global models. The present paper concerns the longwave spectral region, where not much work has been done previously, although the limited previous work has suggested that radiative transfer through cloud sides increases the longwave surface CRE of shallow cumulus by around 30\%. To assist the development of a longwave capability for SPARTACUS, we use a reference case of an isolated, isothermal, optically thick, cubic cloud in vacuum, for which 3-D effects increase CRE by exactly 200\%. It is shown that for any cloud shape, the 3-D effect can be represented in SPARTACUS provided that correct account is made for (1) the effective zenith angle of diffuse radiation emitted from a cloud, (2) the spatial distribution of fluxes in the cloud, (3) cloud clustering that enhances the interception of emitted radiation by neighboring clouds, and (4) radiative smoothing leading to the effective cloud edge length being less than the measured value. We find empirically that the circumference of an ellipse fitted to a horizontal cross section through a cumulus cloud provides a good estimate of the radiatively effective cloud edge length, which provides some guidance to how cloud observations could be analyzed to extract their most important properties for radiation.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a simple analytical framework for the dynamic response of cirrus to a local radiative flux convergence, expressible in terms of three independent modes of cloud evolution. Horizontally narrow and tenuous clouds within a stable environment adjust to radiative heating by ascending gradually across isentropes while spreading sufficiently fast that isentropic surfaces stay nearly flat. Alternatively, optically dense clouds experience very concentrated heating, and if they are also very broad, they develop a convecting mixed layer. Along-isentropic spreading still occurs, but in the form of turbulent density currents rather than laminar flows. A third adjustment mode relates to evaporation, which erodes cloudy air as it lofts, regardless of its optical density. The dominant mode is determined from two dimensionless numbers, whose predictive power is shown in comparisons with high-resolution numerical cloud simulations. The power and simplicity of the approach hints that fast, subgrid-scale radiative\textendash dynamic atmospheric interactions might be efficiently parameterized within slower, coarse-grid climate models.},

For the first time we present a meteorological record from an array of three automatic weather stations (AWS), operated by the authors, for the central part of the climate divide which, together with previously existing Chilean weather stations, complete the transect. These data cover a time period of 3 yr. from October 1999 until September 2002. Air temperatures along the profile are highly correlated. Annual precipitation drops from between 6000 mm and 7000 mm at sea level along the main divide of the mountains to only about 1000 mm at the eastern slopes of the Andes and to as little as 430 mm at Punta Arenas. The variations of rainfall with wind direction and synoptic weather types are markedly different between the central part of the Andes and Punta Arenas. At the center of the climate divide precipitation correlates positively with wind speed from the west, whereas at Punta Arenas, east of the Andes, higher rainfall rates occur with easterly air flow. It is assumed that this reflects the barrier effect of the mountain range of the Andes. The results indicate that in order to make references about present or past climatic variations in Patagonia, it is essential to consider the effect of changes in circulation patterns.}

This definition has been chosen to select heat waves that might impact western European electricity supply. Even though not all such heat waves threaten it, the definition allows to identify a sufficient number of events, the strongest being potentially harmful. The heat waves are characterised by their duration, spatial extent, intensity and severity. The heat wave characteristics are calculated for historical and future climate based on results of climate model simulations conducted during the 5th Phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The uncertainty of future anthropogenic forcing is taken into account by analysing results for the Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. The historical simulations are evaluated against the EOBS gridded station data. The CMIP5 ensemble median captures well the observed mean heat wave characteristics. However, no model simulates a heat wave as severe as observed during August 2003. Under future climate conditions, the heat waves become more frequent and have higher mean duration, extent and intensity. The ensemble spread is larger than the scenario uncertainty. The shift of the temperature distribution is more important for the increase of the cumulative heat wave severity than the broadening of the temperature distribution. However, the broadening leads to an amplification of the cumulative heat wave severity by a factor of 1.7 for RCP4.5 and 1.5 for RCP8.5.},

Data from three events show signatures of riming, aggregation, and dendritic growth. Riming and the growth of graupel are suggested by negative differential reflectivity ZDR and vertically pointing Doppler velocity magnitude |VR| {$>$} 2.0 m s-1; aggregation is indicated by maxima in the downward-relative gradient of radar reflectivity at horizontal polarization ZH below the -15\textdegree C isotherm and positive downward-relative gradients in |VR| when averaged over time. A signature of positive downward-relative gradients in ZH, negative downward-relative gradients in |VR|, and maxima in ZDR is observed near -15\textdegree C during all three events. This signature may be indicative of dendritic growth; preexisting, thick platelike crystals fall faster and grow slower than dendrites, allowing for |VR| to shift toward the slower-falling, rapidly growing dendrites. To test this hypothesis, simplified calculations of the ZH and |VR| gradients are performed for a range of terminal fall speeds of dendrites and isometric crystals. The authors prescribe linear profiles of ZH for the dendrites and isometric crystals, with the resulting profiles and gradients of |VR| determined from a range of particle fall speeds. Both the observed ZH and |VR| gradients are reproduced by the calculations for a large range of fall speeds. However, more observational data are needed to fully constrain these calculations and reject or support explanations for this signature.}

It is found that cloud cover variability near the sea ice margins is strongly linked to sea ice variability. Sea ice retreat is linked to a decrease in low-level cloud amount and a simultaneous increase in midlevel clouds. This pattern is apparent in both data sources. Changes in cloud cover can be explained by changes in the atmospheric temperature structure and an increase in near-surface temperatures resulting from the removal of sea ice. The subsequent decrease in static stability and deepening of the atmospheric boundary layer apparently contribute to the rise in cloud level. The radiative effect of this change is relatively small, as the direct radiative effects of cloud cover changes are compensated for by changes in the temperature and humidity profiles associated with varying ice conditions.},

Its role as a cause of climate changes outside of the Arctic has also attracted much scientific interest. Evidence is mounting that Arctic sea-ice loss can affect weather and climate throughout the Northern Hemisphere. The remote impacts of Arctic sea-ice loss can only be properly represented using models that simulate interactions among the ocean, sea ice, land and atmosphere. A synthesis of six such experiments with different models shows consistent hemispheric-wide atmospheric warming, strongest in the mid-to-high-latitude lower troposphere; an intensification of the wintertime Aleutian Low and, in most cases, the Siberian High; a weakening of the Icelandic Low; and a reduction in strength and southward shift of the mid-latitude westerly winds in winter. The atmospheric circulation response seems to be sensitive to the magnitude and geographic pattern of sea-ice loss and, in some cases, to the background climate state. However, it is unclear whether current-generation climate models respond too weakly to sea-ice change. We advocate for coordinated experiments that use different models and observational constraints to quantify the climate response to Arctic sea-ice loss.},

Studie have identified enhanced poleward atmospheric transport of moisture and heat during spring, leading to increased emission of longwave radiation to the surface. Simultaneously, these studies ruled out the role of shortwave radiation as an effective preconditioning mechanism because of relatively weak incident solar radiation, high surface albedo from sea ice and snow, and increased clouds during spring. These conclusions are derived primarily from atmospheric reanalysis, which may not always accurately represent the Arctic climate system. Here, op-of-atmosphere shortwave radiation observations from a state-of-the-art satellite sensor are compared with ERA-Interim reanalysis to examine similarities and differences in the springtime absorbed shortwave radiation (ASR) over the Arctic Ocean. Distinct biases in regional location and absolute magnitude of ASR anomalies are found between satellite-based measurements and reanalysis. Observations indicate separability between ASR anomalies in spring corresponding to anomalously low and high ice extents in September; the reanalysis fails to capture the full extent of this separability. The causes for the difference in ASR anomalies between observations and reanalysis are considered in terms of the variability in surface albedo and cloud presence. Additionally, biases in reanalysis cloud water during spring are presented and are considered for their impact on overestimating spring downwelling longwave anomalies. Taken together, shortwave radiation should not be overlooked as a contributing mechanism to springtime Arctic atmospheric preconditioning.},

Since the number concentrations of all these hydrometeors are calculated explicitly, all relevant homogenous and heterogenous nucleation processes have been parameterized including the activation of cloud condensation nuclei, which is not predicted in most state-of-the-art cloud resolving models. Therefore the new scheme can discriminate between continental and maritime conditions and can be used for investigations of aerosol effects on the precipitation formation in mixed-phase clouds. In addition, the scheme includes turbulence effects on droplet coalescence, collisional breakup of raindrops and size-dependent collision efficiencies. A new general approximation of the collection kernels and the corresponding collision integrals is introduced.},

Compared to dust-free air masses, a significantly higher amount of ice-containing clouds (25\%\textendash 30\% more) was observed for cloud top temperatures from -10\textdegree C to -20\textdegree C in air masses that contained mineral dust. The midlatitude lidar study is compared with our SAMUM lidar study of tropical stratiform clouds at Cape Verde in the winter of 2008. The comparison reveals that heterogeneous ice formation is much stronger over central Europe and starts at higher temperatures than over the tropical station.

Due to the universality of the geometry of aggregates, the conversion to a graupel-like particle is self-similar and independent from specific properties of the aggregate, when formulated in properly normalized variables. Hence, the particle habit of the primary crystals, the size of the aggregate or the density of the rime mass, does not lead to a structural change in the transition to graupel. Therefore, this transition can be parameterized by a similarity approach using simulations of many individual rimed aggregates. These parameterizations can replace the classic fill-in model used in many cloud models. The parameterizations are applied and tested in a one-dimensional Lagrangian superparticle model to simulate the growth of aggregates in a liquid layer. We find that the similarity model for the geometry of rimed snowflakes leads to a more rapid growth by riming and, hence, an increased precipitation rate compared to the fill-in model. The main reason for this is that the increase of the maximum dimension during the early stages of riming is properly taken into account by the similarity model, whereas it is neglected by the fill-in model.},

As an example, we use the warm-rain formation by collision-coalescence, that is, the parameterization of autoconversion, accretion, and self-collection of droplets in a two-moment framework. Benchmark solutions of the kinetic collection equations are performed using a Monte Carlo superdroplet algorithm. The superdroplet method provides reliable but noisy estimates of the warm-rain process rates. For each process rate, a neural network is trained using standard machine learning techniques. The resulting models make skillful predictions for the process rates when compared to the testing data. However, when solving the ordinary differential equations, the solutions are not as good as those of an established warm-rain parameterization. This deficiency can be seen as a limitation of the machine learning methods that are applied, but at the same time, it points toward a fundamental ill-posedness of the commonly used two-moment warm-rain schemes. More advanced machine learning methods that include a notion of time derivatives, therefore, have the potential to overcome these problems.},

Cloud formation processes occur over a vast range of spatial and temporal scales, which make their thorough numerical representation challenging. Therefore, the impact of parameter choices for simulations of cloud-radiative effects is assessed in the current study. Numerical experiments are carried out using the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model with varying grid spacings between 2.5 and 80 km and with different subgrid-scale parameterization approaches. Simulations are performed over the North Atlantic with either one-moment or two-moment microphysics and with convection being parameterized or explicitly resolved by grid-scale dynamics. Simulated cloud-radiative effects are compared to products derived from Meteosat measurements. Furthermore, a sophisticated cloud classification algorithm is applied to understand the differences and dependencies of simulated and observed cloud-radiative effects. The cloud classification algorithm developed for the satellite observations is also applied to the simulation output based on synthetic infrared brightness temperatures, a novel approach that is not impacted by changing insolation and guarantees a consistent and fair comparison. It is found that flux biases originate equally from clear-sky and cloudy parts of the radiation field. Simulated cloud amounts and cloud-radiative effects are dominated by marine, shallow clouds, and their behavior is highly resolution dependent. Bias compensation between shortwave and longwave flux biases, seen in the coarser simulations, is significantly diminished for higher resolutions. Based on the analysis results, it is argued that cloud-microphysical and cloud-radiative properties have to be adjusted to further improve agreement with observed cloud-radiative effects.},

The seasonal cycles of vertically integrated atmospheric energy storage and the convergence of energy transport from ERA-40, as evaluated for the polar cap (defined by the 70\textdegree N latitude circle), in general compare well with realizations from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research reanalysis over the period 1979\textendash 2001. However, shortcomings in top of atmosphere radiation, as compared to satellite data, and the net surface flux, contribute to large energy budget residuals in ERA-40. The seasonal cycle of atmospheric energy storage is strongly modulated by the net surface flux, which is also the primary driver of seasonal changes in heat storage within the Arctic Ocean. Averaged for an Arctic Ocean domain, the July net surface flux from ERA-40 of -100 W m-2 (i.e., into the ocean), associated with sea ice melt and oceanic sensible heat gain, exceeds the atmospheric energy transport convergence of 91 W m-2. During winter (for which budget residuals are large), oceanic sensible heat loss and sea ice growth yield an upward surface flux of 50\textendash 60 W m-2, complemented with an atmospheric energy convergence of 80\textendash 90 W m-2 to provide a net radiation loss to space of 175\textendash 180 W m-2.},

Arctic ampli?cation is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat ?uxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation ?ux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic ampli?cation are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic ampli?cation being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic.},

  abstract = {A poor representation of cloud structure in a general circulation model (GCM) is widely recognised as a potential source of error in the radiation budget. Here, we develop a new way of representing both horizontal and vertical cloud structure in a radiation scheme. This combines the `Tripleclouds' parametrization, which introduces inhomogeneity by using two cloudy regions in each layer as opposed to one, each with different water content values, with `exponential-random' overlap, in which clouds in adjacent layers are not overlapped maximally, but according to a vertical decorrelation scale. This paper, Part I of two, aims to parametrize the two effects such that they can be used in a GCM. To achieve this, we first review a number of studies for a globally applicable value of fractional standard deviation of water content for use in Tripleclouds. We obtain a value of 0.75 {$\pm$} 0.18 from a variety of different types of observations, with no apparent dependence on cloud type or gridbox size. Then, through a second short review, we create a parametrization of decorrelation scale for use in exponential-random overlap, which varies the scale linearly with latitude from 2.9 km at the Equator to 0.4 km at the poles. When applied to radar data, both components are found to have radiative impacts capable of offsetting biases caused by cloud misrepresentation. Part II of this paper implements Tripleclouds and exponential-random overlap into a radiation code and examines both their individual and combined impacts on the global radiation budget using re-analysis data.},

  abstract = {In certain circumstances, millimeter-wavelength Doppler radar velocity spectra can be used to estimate the microphysical composition of both phases of mixed-phase clouds. This distinction is possible when the cloud properties are such that they produce a bimodal Doppler velocity spectrum. Under these conditions, the Doppler spectrum moments of the distinct liquid and ice spectral modes may be computed independently and used to quantitatively derive properties of the liquid droplet and ice particle size distributions. Additionally, the cloud liquid spectral mode, which is a tracer for clear-air motions, can be used to estimate the vertical air motion and to correct estimates of ice particle fall speeds. A mixed-phase cloud case study from the NASA Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cloud Layers- Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE) is used to illustrate this new retrieval approach. The case of interest occurred on 29 July 2002 when a supercooled liquid cloud layer based at 5 km AGL and precipitating ice crystals advected over a ground measurement site. Ground-based measurements from both 35- and 94-GHz radars revealed clear bimodal Doppler velocity spectra within this cloud layer. Profiles of radar reflectivity were computed independently from the liquid and ice spectral modes of the velocity spectra. Empirical reflectivity- based relationships were then used to derive profiles of both liquid and ice microphysical parameters, such as water content and particle size. Although the ice crystals extended down to a height of 4 km, the radar measurements were able to distinguish the base of the cloud liquid at 5 km, in good agreement with cloud-base measurements from a collocated micropulse lidar. Furthermore, radar-derived cloud liquid water paths were in good agreement with liquid water paths derived from a collocated microwave radiometer. Results presented here demonstrate the ability of the radar to both identify and quantify the presence of both phases in some mixed-phase clouds. They also demonstrate that, in terms of radar reflectivity, the ice component of mixed-phase clouds typically dominates the radar signal, while in terms of mean Doppler velocity, the liquid component can make a significant contribution. The high temporal resolution, 94-GHz Doppler radar observations were able to reveal a periodic cloud-top updraft that, combined with horizontal wind speeds, suggests a horizontal scale for the in-cloud circulations.},

  abstract = {Arctic mixed-phase cloud macro- and microphysical properties are derived from a year of radar, lidar, microwave radiometer, and radiosonde observations made as part of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) Program in the Beaufort Sea in 1997?98. Mixed-phase clouds occurred 41 \% of the time and were most frequent in the spring and fall transition seasons. These clouds often consisted of a shallow, cloud-top liquid layer from which ice particles formed and fell, although deep, multilayered mixed-phase cloud scenes were also observed. On average, individual cloud layers persisted for 12 h, while some mixed-phase cloud systems lasted for many days. Ninety percent of the observed mixed-phase clouds were 0.5?3 km thick, had a cloud base of 0?2 km, and resided at a temperature of  25\dbend to  5\dbend C. Under the assumption that the relatively large ice crystals dominate the radar signal, ice properties were retrieved from these clouds using radar reflectivity measurements. The annual average ice particle mean diameter, ice water content, and ice water path were 93  m, 0.027 g m  3 , and 42 g m  2 , respectively. These values are all larger than those found in single-phase ice clouds at SHEBA. Vertically resolved cloud liquid properties were not retrieved; however, the annual average, microwave radiometer?derived liquid water path (LWP) in mixed-phase clouds was 61 g m  2 . This value is larger than the average LWP observed in single-phase liquid clouds because the liquid water layers in the mixed-phase clouds tended to be thicker than those in all-liquid clouds. Although mixed-phase clouds were observed down to temperatures of about  40\dbend C, the liquid fraction (ratio of LWP to total condensed water path) increased on average from zero at  24\dbend C to one at  14\dbend C. The observations show a range of  25\dbend C at any given liquid fraction and a phase transition relationship that may change moderately with season.},

The method is applicable to cloud volumes containing small particles, in this case liquid droplets, which are assumed to trace vertical air motions because of their limited size. The presence of liquid droplets is confirmed using multiple ground-based remote sensors. Corrections for Doppler spectrum broadening due to turbulence, wind shear, and radar beamwidth are applied. As a result of the turbulence broadening correction, the turbulent dissipation rate can also be estimated. This retrieval is demonstrated using measurements from the Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program's (ARM) site in Barrow, Alaska, during the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) of autumn 2004. Comparisons of the retrievals with measurements by research aircraft near Barrow indicate that, on the whole, the retrievals perform well. A small bias in vertical velocity between the retrievals and aircraft measurements is found, based on a statistical comparison of four cases comprising nearly 6 h of data. Turbulent dissipation rate comparisons suggest that the radar-retrieved vertical velocity might be slightly underestimated because of an underestimate of the turbulence broadening correction. However, large uncertainties in aircraft vertical velocity measurements likely impact the comparison.},

  abstract = {The characteristics of Arctic mixed-phase stratiform clouds and their relation to vertical air motions are examined using ground-based observations during the Mixed-Phase Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) in Barrow, Alaska, during fall 2004. The cloud macrophysical, microphysical, and dynamical properties are derived from a suite of active and passive remote sensors. Low-level, single-layer, mixed-phase stratiform clouds are typically topped by a 400\textendash 700-m-deep liquid water layer from which ice crystals precipitate. These clouds are strongly dominated (85\% by mass) by liquid water. On average, an in-cloud updraft of 0.4 m s-1 sustains the clouds, although cloud-scale circulations lead to a variability of up to {$\pm$}2 m s-1 from the average. Dominant scales-of-variability in both vertical air motions and cloud microphysical properties retrieved by this analysis occur at 0.5\textendash 10-km wavelengths. In updrafts, both cloud liquid and ice mass grow, although the net liquid mass growth is usually largest. Between updrafts, nearly all ice falls out and/or sublimates while the cloud liquid diminishes but does not completely evaporate. The persistence of liquid water throughout these cloud cycles suggests that ice-forming nuclei, and thus ice crystal, concentrations must be limited and that water vapor is plentiful. These details are brought together within the context of a conceptual model relating cloud-scale dynamics and microphysics.},

  abstract = {Cloud phase de?nes many cloud properties and determines the ways in which clouds interact with other aspects of the climate system. The occurrence fraction and characteristics of clouds distinguished by their phase are examined at three Arctic atmospheric observatories. Each observatory has the basic suite of instruments that are necessary to identify cloud phase, namely, cloud radar, depolarization lidar, microwave radiometer, and twice-daily radiosondes. At these observatories, ice clouds are more prevalent than mixed-phase clouds, which are more prevalent than liquid-only clouds. Cloud ice occurs 60 \%?70 \% of the time over a typical year, at heights up to 11 km. Liquid water occurs at temperatures above 2408C and is increasingly more likely as temperatures increase. Within the temperature range from 2408 to 2308C, liquid water occurs in 3 \%?5 \% of the observed cloudiness. Liquid water is found higher in the atmosphere when accompanied by ice; there are few liquid-only clouds above 3 km, although liquid in mixed-phase clouds occurs at heights up to about 7?8 km. Regardless of temperature or height, liquid water occurs 56 \% of the time at Barrow, Alaska, and at a western Arctic Ocean site, but only 32 \% of the time at Eureka, Nunavut, Canada. This signi?cant difference in liquid occurrence is due to a relatively dry lower troposphere during summer at Eureka in addition to warmer cloud temperatures with more persistent liquid water layers at the far western locations. The most persistent liquid clouds at these locations occur continuously for more than 70 h in the autumn and more than 30 h in the winter. Ice clouds persist for much longer than do liquid clouds at Eureka and occur more frequently in the winter season, leading to a total cloud occurrence annual cycle that is distinct from the other observatories.},

An Arctic-specific, ground-based, multisensor cloud retrieval system is described here and applied to 2 yr of observations from Barrow, Alaska. Over these 2 yr, clouds occurred 75\% of the time, with cloud ice and liquid each occurring nearly 60\% of the time. Liquid water occurred at least 25\% of the time, even in winter, and existed up to heights of 8 km. The vertically integrated mass of liquid was typically larger than that of ice. While it is generally difficult to evaluate the overall uncertainty of a comprehensive cloud retrieval system of this type, radiative flux closure analyses were performed in which flux calculations using the derived microphysical properties were compared with measurements at the surface and the top of the atmosphere. Radiative closure biases were generally smaller for cloudy scenes relative to clear skies, while the variability of flux closure results was only moderately larger than under clear skies. The best closure at the surface was obtained for liquid-containing clouds. Radiative closure results were compared with those based on a similar, yet simpler, cloud retrieval system. These comparisons demonstrated the importance of accurate cloud-phase and cloud-type classification, and specifically the identification of liquid water, for determining radiative fluxes. Enhanced retrievals of liquid water path for thin clouds were also shown to improve radiative flux calculations.},

  abstract = {Cloud feedbacks and processes have been clearly highlighted as a leading source of uncertainty for understanding global climate sensitivity (IPCC 2007). Clouds play fundamental and complex roles in the climate system by redistributing heat and moisture through modulation of atmospheric radiation, latent heating processes, and serving as a critical link in the hydrological cycle. They are affected by aerosol properties, large-scale circulation patterns, interactions with the surface, and tropospheric thermodynamic structure. Importantly, cloud systems are entwined in many feedbacks acting on both large and small scales (Stephens 2005). At the crux of the signi?cant uncertainty associated with cloud processes is the fact that all of these properties, processes, and interactions of clouds with the earth?s climate system vary widely across the globe leading to a diversity, variability, and complexity of cloud systems that is dif?cult to represent using numerical models. Reaching climate equilibrium after some perturbation to the system can take decades of model simulated time; however, Gregory and Webb (2008) and Andrews and Forster (2008) found that changes in clouds that are typically attributed to feedbacks (i.e., Soden et al. 2004; Dufresne and Bony 2008) are actually realized rapidly after a sudden CO2 doubling. These findings are consistent with Williams and Tselioudis (2007) who show that much of the disparity between models and observations is because models fail to represent clouds accurately within present-day meteorological regimes. This distinction is important because feedbacks are largely beyond the reach of observations. However, a rapid response by clouds to altered meteorological regimes suggests that much of the uncertainty in what is normally termed cloud feedbacks arises because of differences in how the parameterized macro- and microphysical properties of clouds respond to changes locally. This further implies that improved understanding of the interactions between cloud processes and the broader climate system in the present climate can have a direct bearing on the fidelity of climate change predictions if that understanding can be encoded in models. Thus, understanding cloud systems at a physical process level is critical to advancing numerical earth system modeling abilities. Such a need for process level understanding is becoming increasingly important as numerical models move to finer and finer spatial scales. It is not unreasonable to assume that global cloud resolving models (Satoh et al. 2008) will be the preferred modeling tools in the future. As convective parameterizations are abandoned in favor of explicit microphysical parameterizations, it is the microphysical parameterizations that are increasingly being recognized as the weak link (Bryan and Morrison 2012; Han et al. 2013). Advancing numerical earth system modeling abilities requires tackling the complexities of clouds, including the following: formation processes and particle nucleation; transfer of water among three phases; evolution of particle size distributions related to growth, autoconversion, dynamics, and entrainment; growth regimes that lead to cloud particles of different shapes, sizes, and fall speeds; and scattering and absorption of atmospheric radiation. To date many of these processes have been difficult to unravel and describe with predictive skill because they are difficult to observe. Many processes, such as entrainment and cloud particle formation, are largely hidden from direct observational capabilities. Further, the dimensionality of the problem (i.e., complexity of cloud systems) is much greater than the available observational constraints. These deficiencies together call for dedicated efforts to expand and improve cloud observational abilities in the form of new measurement technologies and sophisticated analytical tools that are better able to probe deeply into cloud processes and ultimately better constrain the cloud problem. Over the past two decades, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program (Stokes and Schwartz 1994; Ackerman and Stokes 2003) has taken a leading role in addressing the observational and modeling complexities of clouds. One foundational objective of the ARM Program has been to improve the representation of clouds in numerical models. To support this objective, the program has developed and operated diverse suites of ground-based cloud-sensing instrumentation at several geographically diverse locations. These efforts have produced publicly available cloud observational records that are historically unprecedented in length, continuity, and sophistication. A major thrust of ARM?s cloud activities has been in the development of cloud retrieval algorithms wherein instrument-level measurements are exploited to derive the geophysical properties of clouds that are needed to understand and represent cloud processes. These retrieval algorithms are a critical step in bridging the gap between basic measurements and model improvement. They provide input to observational and modeling process studies that are used to synthesize and generalize cloud knowledge in order to support model parameterization development. Here we provide an historical overview of ARM?s contributions toward cloud property retrievals. The overview covers advances in using specific passive and active instruments that are in operation at ARM sites and the expansion of multisensor retrieval approaches. It also addresses the general topic of uncertainty, how it is evaluated, and what it means for our ability to use cloud information derived from ground-based sensors. While there have been many individual contributions over the past two decades from investigators supported by ARM, the focus here is primarily on the larger movements and novel accomplishments that distinguish the ARM Program as a global leader in cloud research and retrieval development. We conclude with a look at the pathway forward, considering the possibilities presented by new enhanced measurements, the need to develop sophisticated forward models relating physical processes to observational parameters, and how these together can further advance cloud retrievals.},

  abstract = {With the Arctic rapidly changing, the needs to observe, understand, and model the changes are essential. To support these needs, an annual cycle of observations of atmospheric properties, processes, and interactions were made while drifting with the sea ice across the central Arctic during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) expedition from October 2019 to September 2020. An international team designed and implemented the comprehensive program to document and characterize all aspects of the Arctic atmospheric system in unprecedented detail, using a variety of approaches, and across multiple scales. These measurements were coordinated with other observational teams to explore cross-cutting and coupled interactions with the Arctic Ocean, sea ice, and ecosystem through a variety of physical and biogeochemical processes. This overview outlines the breadth and complexity of the atmospheric research program, which was organized into 4 subgroups: atmospheric state, clouds and precipitation, gases and aerosols, and energy budgets. Atmospheric variability over the annual cycle revealed important influences from a persistent large-scale winter circulation pattern, leading to some storms with pressure and winds that were outside the interquartile range of past conditions suggested by long-term reanalysis. Similarly, the MOSAiC location was warmer and wetter in summer than the reanalysis climatology, in part due to its close proximity to the sea ice edge. The comprehensiveness of the observational program for characterizing and analyzing atmospheric phenomena is demonstrated via a winter case study examining air mass transitions and a summer case study examining vertical atmospheric evolution. Overall, the MOSAiC atmospheric program successfully met its objectives and was the most comprehensive atmospheric measurement program to date conducted over the Arctic sea ice. The obtained data will support a broad range of coupled-system scientific research and provide an important foundation for advancing multiscale modeling capabilities in the Arctic.},

ACTOS allows for collocated measurements of the dynamical and cloud microphysical parameters with a spatial resolution of better than 10 cm. The interaction between turbulence and cloud microphysical processes is demonstrated using the following two cloud cases from recent helicopter measurements: i) a cumulus cloud with a low degree of turbulence and without strong vertical dynamics, and, in contrast, ii) an actively growing cloud with increased turbulence and stronger updrafts. The turbulence and microphysical measurements suggest that entrainment at the tops of these two clouds occurs by inhomogeneous and homogeneous mixing, respectively.}

This paper is a synthesis of research on turbulence effects on cloud droplets that includes field and laboratory studies. Results from cloud measurements show that the turbulence exhibits similar internal intermittency to that observed in the laboratory, and in direct numerical simulations. We explore the consequences of this by relating measurements of droplet accelerations in the laboratory, to conditions observed in the clouds. We show that there is a strong likelihood of droplet accelerations in clouds exceeding the acceleration due to gravity. We discuss these observations in terms of the dynamics of droplets, including velocity statistics and clustering, and their influence on droplet growth.},

  abstract = {Polar cloud radiative forcing plays a crucial role in the determination of the surface and atmospheric energy balance through processes which are not yet fully understood. While there is a broad and fairly complete database of cloud measurements from several Arctic sites and field campaigns through the past two decades, the recent one-year long U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) West Antarctic Radiation Experiment (AWARE) field campaign at McMurdo Station has provided a hitherto unmatched multiple-instrument set of ground-based Antarctic cloud measurements. These observations are processed and used to derive the main cloud and liquid containing layer properties: occurrence fraction, cloud persistence and boundaries, and configuration relative to temperature and moisture inversions. The results are compared to previous Arctic observations. It is concluded that clouds and liquid-bearing layers over McMurdo Station are essentially less prevalent and persistent than their Arctic counterparts. However, they typically have higher bases and show a weaker temperature dependence than in the Arctic, suggesting a more ``pristine'' Antarctic atmosphere. In addition, the clouds (including both water phases) typically extend toward relatively lower altitudes, and their relation to inversions near cloud top is often similar to those observed in the Arctic.},

We utilized the measurements gathered at Barrow, Alaska, in 2015, to produce comprehensive statistics about the Doppler-radar moments and the Doppler spectra. We find that the cloud-top liquid-bearing cloud layers (LBCLs) can potentially be reliably detected at high percentages with the KAZR when the signal is above the radar noise floor. However, embedded LBCLs are significantly more challenging to detect and could potentially be reliably separated in bulk processing only in exceptional cases, which account for not more than a few tens of percent of these cloud layer occurrences.},

However, polar LBCs are commonly initiated under stable, nonturbulent conditions. Using long term data from the North Slope of Alaska and McMurdo, Antarctica, we show that nonturbulent conditions prevail in 25\% of detected LBCs, surmised to be preferentially early in their lifecycle. We conclude that nonturbulent LBCs are likely common over the polar regions owing primarily to atmospheric temperature and stability. Such stable environments are known to support gravity wave activity. Using large eddy simulations, we find that short to intermediate period gravity waves may catalyze turbulence formation when aerosol particles available for activation are sufficiently small. We posit that the frequent occurrence of nonturbulent LBCs over the polar regions has implications for polar aerosol cloud interactions and their parameterization in large scale models.},

The statistical properties of precipitation echoes are reviewed and related to measurements of atmospheric and WSR-57 weather radar parameters. A digital integrator, successfully adapted to the WSR-57, can reduce power estimate variance below I dB without compromising the resolution of the WSR-57 radar. Although specific design parameters are tied to the WSR-57 parameters, sufficiently general criteria are developed to permit design engineers to relate these results to other radars. We derive the statistical properties of echo power samples averaged both in range and time. Engineering and meteorological factors affecting the type of averaging technique employed (exponential weighted time average and linear range average) and averaging intervals selected are considered in detail. The expected value and variance associated with digital data processing due to the analog-to-digital conversion and the arithmetic operations are analyzed. The engineering requirements necessary to insure a minimal signal degradation due to these effects are given. It is shown that, for integrator parameters used, the variance contributed by the time averaging loop (exponential window function) is small compared with that variance due to range averaging truncation, in turn small compared with the input echo power variance. Relations are derived between integrator and radar parameters and minimum scale of resolved precipitation structure. Sample PPI displays of integrated echo returns from severe convective storms are presented.},

Two main constructs related to aerosol effects on clouds have been postulated: (i) the ``albedo effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol results in increased droplet concentrations that generate increases in cloud albedo, all else (particularly cloud water) being equal; (ii) the ``lifetime effect'' whereby anthropogenic aerosol suppresses precipitation and results in clouds with more liquid water, higher fractional cloudiness, and longer lifetimes. Based on new observations presented here, and supported by previous fine-scale modeling studies, we suggest that the balance of evidence shows that non-precipitating cumulus clouds can experience an evaporation-entrainment feedback, and respond to aerosol perturbations in a manner inconsistent with the traditional ``lifetime effect.'' Because most cumulus clouds evaporate without producing significant precipitation, this is particularly relevant to estimates of aerosol indirect effects on climate. Citation: Small, J. D., P. Y.

This study presents algorithms that we use to retrieve vertical air velocity (Vair) and hydrometeors. The algorithm calculating Vair is based on small-particle tracers, which considers the terminal velocity of small particles negligible and, thereby, Vair corresponds to the velocity of the small particles. The algorithm classifying hydrometeors consists of calculating the terminal velocity of hydrometeors and the vertical temperature profile. It identifies six hydrometeor types (cloud droplets, ice, and four precipitating particles: rain, graupel, snow, and hail) based on the calculated terminal velocity of hydrometeors, temperature, Vair, and Linear Depolarization Ratio. The results of both the Vair and the distribution of hydrometeors were found to be realistic for a thunderstorm associated with significant lightning activity on 1 June 2018.},

This case was chosen because it allows the cloud to form in response to radiative cooling starting from a cloud-free state, rather than requiring the cloud ice and liquid to adjust to an initial cloudy state. Sensitivity studies are used to identify whether there are buffering feedbacks that limit the impact of aerosol perturbations. The results of this study indicate that perturbations in ice nucleating particles (INPs) dominate over cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) perturbations; i.e., an equivalent fractional decrease in CCN and INPs results in an increase in the cloud-top longwave cooling rate, even though the droplet effective radius increases and the cloud emissivity decreases. The dominant effect of ice in the simulated mixed-phase cloud is a thinning rather than a glaciation, causing the mixed-phase clouds to radiate as a grey body and the radiative properties of the cloud to be more sensitive to aerosol perturbations. It is demonstrated that allowing prognostic CCN and INPs causes a layering of the aerosols, with increased concentrations of CCN above cloud top and increased concentrations of INPs at the base of the cloud-driven mixed layer. This layering contributes to the maintenance of the cloud liquid, which drives the dynamics of the cloud system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Neutrally stratified are mixedphaseclouds where radiative-cooling near cloud top producesturbulence that generates a cloud-driven mixed layer.When this layer mixes with the surface-generated turbulence,the cloud layer is coupled to the surface, whereas when suchan interaction does not occur, it remains decoupled; the latterstate is most frequently observed. The decoupled cloudsare usually higher compared to the coupled; differences inthickness or cloud water properties between the two casesare however not found. The surface fluxes are also verysimilar for both states. The decoupled clouds exhibit a bimodalthermodynamic structure, depending on the depth ofthe sub-cloud mixed layer (SCML): clouds with shallowerSCMLs are disconnected from the surface by weak inversions,whereas those that lay over a deeper SCML are associatedwith stronger inversions at the decoupling height.Neutrally stratified clouds generally precipitate; the evaporation/sublimation of precipitation often enhances the decouplingstate. Finally, stably stratified clouds are usually lower,geometrically and optically thinner, non-precipitating liquidwaterclouds, not containing enough liquid to drive efficientmixing through cloud-top cooling.},

In contrast with recent advances for liquid clouds, few observational constraints exist regarding the ice crystal number concentration (Ni). This study investigates how combined lidar\textendash radar measurements can be used to provide satellite estimates of Ni, using a methodology that constrains moments of a parameterized particle size distribution (PSD). The operational liDAR\textendash raDAR (DARDAR) product serves as an existing base for this method, which focuses on ice clouds with temperatures Tc{$<-$}30C. Theoretical considerations demonstrate the capability for accurate retrievals of Ni, apart from a possible bias in the concentration in small crystals when Tc{$>-$}50 {$\circ$}C, due to the assumption of a monomodal PSD shape in the current method. This is verified via a comparison of satellite estimates to coincident in situ measurements, which additionally demonstrates the sufficient sensitivity of lidar\textendash radar observations to Ni. Following these results, satellite estimates of Ni are evaluated in the context of a case study and a preliminary climatological analysis based on 10 years of global data. Despite a lack of other large-scale references, this evaluation shows a reasonable physical consistency in Ni spatial distribution patterns. Notably, increases in Ni are found towards cold temperatures and, more significantly, in the presence of strong updrafts, such as those related to convective or orographic uplifts. Further evaluation and improvement of this method are necessary, although these results already constitute a first encouraging step towards large-scale observational constraints for Ni. Part 2 of this series uses this new dataset to examine the controls on Ni.},

Yet, observations by precipitation radar offer the potential to get better insight in Antarctic SR. Relations between radar reflectivity (Ze) and snowfall rate (Ze-SR relations) are however not available over Antarctica. Here, we analyse observations from the first Micro Rain Radar (MRR) in Antarctica together with an optical disdrometer (Precipitation Imaging Package; PIP), deployed at the Princess Elisabeth station. The relation Ze = A*SRB was derived using PIP observations and its uncertainty was quantified using a bootstrapping approach, randomly sampling within the range of uncertainty. This uncertainty was used to assess the uncertainty in snowfall rates derived by the MRR. We find a value of A = 18 [11\textendash{} 43] and B = 1.10 [0.97\textendash{} 1.17]. The uncertainty on snowfall rates of the MRR based on the Ze-SR relation are limited to 40\%, due to the propagation of uncertainty in both Ze as well as SR, resulting in some compensation. The prefactor (A) of the Ze-SR relation is sensitive to the median diameter of the snow particles. Larger particles, typically found closer to the coast, lead to an increase of the value of the prefactor (A = 44). Smaller particles, typical of more inland locations, obtain lower values for the prefactor (A = 7). The exponent (B) of the Ze-SR relation is insensitive to the median diameter of the snow particles. In contrast with previous studies for various locations, shape uncertainty is not the main source of uncertainty of the Ze-SR relation. Parameter uncertainty is found to be the most dominant term, mainly driven by the uncertainty in mass-size relation of different snow particles. Uncertainties on the snow particle size distribution are negligible in this study as they are directly measured. Future research aiming at reducing the uncertainty of Ze-SR relations should therefore focus on obtaining reliable estimates of the mass-size relations of snow particles.},

  abstract = {Lagrangian trajectories are widely used in the atmospheric sciences, for instance to identify flow structures in extratropical cyclones (e.g., warm conveyor belts) and long-range transport pathways of moisture and trace substances. Here a new version of the Lagrangian analysis tool LAGRANTO (Wernli and Davies, 1997) is introduced, which offers considerably enhanced functionalities. Trajectory starting positions can be defined easily and flexibly based on different geometrical and/or meteorological conditions, e.g., equidistantly spaced within a prescribed region and on a stack of pressure (or isentropic) levels. After the computation of the trajectories, a versatile selection of trajectories is offered based on single or combined criteria. These criteria are passed to LAGRANTO with a simple command language (e.g., "GT:PV:2" readily translates into a selection of all trajectories with potential vorticity, PV, greater than 2 PVU; 1 PVU = 10-6 K m2 kg-1 s-1). Full versions of this new version of LAGRANTO are available for global ECMWF and regional COSMO data, and core functionality is provided for the regional WRF and MetUM models and the global 20th Century Reanalysis data set. The paper first presents the intuitive application of LAGRANTO for the identification of a warm conveyor belt in the North Atlantic. A further case study then shows how LAGRANTO can be used to quasi-operationally diagnose stratosphere\textendash troposphere exchange events. Whereas these examples rely on the ECMWF version, the COSMO version and input fields with 7 km horizontal resolution serve to resolve the rather complex flow structure associated with orographic blocking due to the Alps, as shown in a third example. A final example illustrates the tool's application in source\textendash receptor analysis studies. The new distribution of LAGRANTO is publicly available and includes auxiliary tools, e.g., to visualize trajectories. A detailed user guide describes all LAGRANTO capabilities.},

  abstract = {The concept of cloud radiative forcing (CRF) is commonly applied to quantify the impact of clouds on the surface radiative energy budget (REB). In the Arctic, specific radiative interactions between microphysical and macrophysical properties of clouds and the surface strongly modify the warming or cooling effect of clouds, complicating the estimate of CRF obtained from observations or models. Clouds tend to increase the broadband surface albedo over snow or sea ice surfaces compared to cloud-free conditions. However, this effect is not adequately considered in the derivation of CRF in the Arctic so far. Therefore, we have quantified the effects caused by surface-albedo\textendash cloud interactions over highly reflective snow or sea ice surfaces on the CRF using radiative transfer simulations and below-cloud airborne observations above the heterogeneous springtime marginal sea ice zone (MIZ) during the Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day (ACLOUD) campaign. The impact of a modified surface albedo in the presence of clouds, as compared to cloud-free conditions, and its dependence on cloud optical thickness is found to be relevant for the estimation of the shortwave CRF. A method is proposed to consider this surface albedo effect on CRF estimates by continuously retrieving the cloud-free surface albedo from observations under cloudy conditions, using an available snow and ice albedo parameterization. Using ACLOUD data reveals that the estimated average shortwave cooling by clouds almost doubles over snow- and ice-covered surfaces (-62 W m-2 instead of -32 W m-2), if surface-albedo\textendash cloud interactions are considered. As a result, the observed total (shortwave plus longwave) CRF shifted from a warming effect to an almost neutral one. Concerning the seasonal cycle of the surface albedo, it is demonstrated that this effect enhances shortwave cooling in periods when snow dominates the surface and potentially weakens the cooling by optically thin clouds during the summertime melting season. These findings suggest that the surface-albedo\textendash cloud interaction should be considered in global climate models and in long-term studies to obtain a realistic estimate of the shortwave CRF to quantify the role of clouds in Arctic amplification.},

  abstract = {Cloud ice particle effective radius in atmospheric models is usually parametrized. A widely-used parametrization comprises a strong dependence on the temperature. Utilizing available satellite-based estimates of both cloud ice particle effective radius and cloud-top temperature we evaluate if a similar temperature-dependence exists in these observations. We find that for very low cloud-top temperatures the modeled cloud ice particle effective radius generally agrees on average with satellite observations. For high sub-zero temperatures however, the modeled cloud ice particle effective radius becomes very large, which is not seen in the satellite observations. We conclude that the investigated parametrization for the cloud ice particle effective radius, and parametrizations with a similar temperature dependence, likely produce systematic biases at the cloud top. Supporting previous studies, our findings suggest that the vertical structure of clouds should be taken into account as factor in potential future updates of the parametrizations for cloud ice particle effective radius.}

  abstract = {CloudSat is a satellite experiment designed to measure the vertical structure of clouds from space. The expected launch of CloudSat is planned for 2004, and once launched, CloudSat will orbit in formation as part of a constellation of satellites (the A-Train) that includes NASA's Aqua and Aura satellites, a NASA\textendash CNES lidar satellite (CALIPSO), and a CNES satellite carrying a polarimeter (PARASOL). A unique feature that CloudSat brings to this constellation is the ability to fly a precise orbit enabling the fields of view of the CloudSat radar to be overlapped with the CALIPSO lidar footprint and the other measurements of the constellation. The precision and near simultaneity of this overlap creates a unique multisatellite observing system for studying the atmospheric processes essential to the hydrological cycle. The vertical profiles of cloud properties provided by CloudSat on the global scale fill a critical gap in the investigation of feedback mechanisms linking clouds to climate. Measuring these profiles requires a combination of active and passive instruments, and this will be achieved by combining the radar data of CloudSat with data from other active and passive sensors of the constellation. This paper describes the underpinning science and general overview of the mission, provides some idea of the expected products and anticipated application of these products, and the potential capability of the A-Train for cloud observations. Notably, the CloudSat mission is expected to stimulate new areas of research on clouds. The mission also provides an important opportunity to demonstrate active sensor technology for future scientific and tactical applications. The CloudSat mission is a partnership between NASA's JPL, the Canadian Space Agency, Colorado State University, the U.S. Air Force, and the U.S. Department of Energy.},

  abstract = {One of the most successful demonstrations of an integrated approach to observe Earth from multiple perspectives is the A-Train satellite constellation. The science enabled by this constellation flourished with the introduction of the two active sensors carried by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) CloudSat and the NASA?Centre National d?Etudes Spatiales (CNES) Cloud?Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellites that were launched together on 28 April 2006. These two missions have provided a 10-yr demonstration of coordinated formation flying that made it possible to develop integrated products and that offered new insights into key atmospheric processes. The progress achieved over this decade of observations, summarized in this paper, clearly demonstrate the fundamental importance of the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol for understanding the influences of the larger-scale atmospheric circulation on aerosol, the hydrological cycle, the cloud-scale physics, and the formation of the major storm systems of Earth. The research also underscored inherent ambiguities in radiance data in describing cloud properties and how these active systems have greatly enhanced passive observation. It is now clear that monitoring the vertical structure of clouds and aerosol is essential, and a climate data record is now being constructed. These pioneering efforts are to be continued with the Earth Clouds, Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission planned for launch in 2019.},

In early 2010, the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology and the Caribbean Institute for Meteorology and Hydrology established the Barbados Cloud Observatory (BCO) on the windward edge of Barbados. At 13\dbend N the BCO samples the seasonal migration of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ), from the well-developed winter trades dominated by shallow cumulus to the transition to deep convection as the ITCZ migrates northward during boreal summer. The BCO is also well situated to observe the remote meteorological impact of Saharan dust and biomass burning. In its first six years of operation, and through complementary intensive observing periods using the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), the BCO has become a cornerstone of efforts to understand the relationship between cloudiness, circulation, and climate change.},

  abstract = {As the Arctic continues to warm, summer sea ice will continue to recede and a greater expanse of Arctic waters will become navigable. These changes may result in an increase in vessel traffic to the region, including via the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR), through the high seas area of the central Arctic Ocean (CAO). This paper begins with a review of the literature on Arctic vessel traffic to assess the potential effects of various stressors related to vessel traffic in the Arctic Ocean. Available data concerning environmental and safety risks for the Arctic Ocean are used to propose vessel TSR vessel traffic routes that can reduce those risks. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of several examples of vulnerability assessments focused on impacts from vessel traffic in the Arctic as potential models for future work specific to the CAO. The results from this review indicate vessel oiling, air pollution, and noise from icebreakers are immediate concerns to the Arctic Ocean that will likely worsen as the region becomes more navigable and vessel traffic increases. The proposed vessel routes for the Arctic Ocean are meant to serve as a starting point for further discussions before the region becomes fully navigable. As additional data become available, these efforts can be refined further, and a rigorous vulnerability assessment may become possible. Designation as a Particularly Sensitive Sea Area under international law could provide a useful mechanism for creating and updating precautionary shipping measures as more information becomes available.},

The relations are expressed as boundaries and thresholds in a space of polarimetric radar variables. Thus, the foundation is laid out for identification of hydrometeor types (species), estimation of characteristics of hydrometeor species (size, concentrations, etc.), and quantification of bulk hydrometeor contents (amounts).

  abstract = {Understanding how dynamical and aerosol inputs affect the temporal variability of hydrometeor formation in climate models will help to explain sources of model diversity in cloud forcing, to provide robust comparisons with data, and, ultimately, to reduce the uncertainty in estimates of the aerosol indirect effect. This variability attribution can be done at various spatial and temporal resolutions with metrics derived from online adjoint sensitivities of droplet and crystal number to relevant inputs. Such metrics are defined and calculated from simulations using the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Model, Version 5 (GEOS-5) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model Version 5.1 (CAM5.1). Input updraft velocity fluctuations can explain as much as 48\% of temporal variability in output ice crystal number and 61\% in droplet number in GEOS-5 and up to 89\% of temporal variability in output ice crystal number in CAM5.1. In both models, this vertical velocity attribution depends strongly on altitude. Despite its importance for hydrometeor formation, simulated vertical velocity distributions are rarely evaluated against observations due to the sparsity of relevant data. Coordinated effort by the atmospheric community to develop more consistent, observationally based updraft treatments will help to close this knowledge gap.},

  abstract = {Along with minimizing parameter uncertainty, understanding the cause of temporal and spatial variability of the nucleated ice crystal number, Ni, is key to improving the representation of cirrus clouds in climate models. To this end, sensitivities of Ni to input variables like aerosol number and diameter provide valuable information about nucleation regime and efficiency for a given model formulation. Here we use the adjoint model of the adjoint of a cirrus formation parameterization (Barahona and Nenes, 2009b) to understand Ni variability for various ice-nucleating particle (INP) spectra. Inputs are generated with the Community Atmosphere Model version 5, and simulations are done with a theoretically derived spectrum, an empirical lab-based spectrum and two field-based empirical spectra that differ in the nucleation threshold for black carbon particles and in the active site density for dust. The magnitude and sign of Ni sensitivity to insoluble aerosol number can be directly linked to nucleation regime and efficiency of various INP. The lab-based spectrum calculates much higher INP efficiencies than field-based ones, which reveals a disparity in aerosol surface properties. Ni sensitivity to temperature tends to be low, due to the compensating effects of temperature on INP spectrum parameters; this low temperature sensitivity regime has been experimentally reported before but never deconstructed as done here.},

  abstract = {Radiative parametrizations for both ice and water clouds are developed in terms of liquid/ice water content, based on Mie scattering theory. For ice crystals the application of Mie theory is guided by the hexagonal-crystal/equivalent-spheres comparison of Takano and Liou. These parametrizations are extensively tested against measurements from aircraft and are shown to perform satisfactorily, although corrections for unobserved small crystals and the effect of crystal shape are large and not currently well defined. The parametrizations are then used to investigate the effect of mixed-phase clouds on radiative transfer. It is found that, because the radiative properties of ice crystals and liquid droplets are significantly different, the radiative properties of mixed-phase clouds cannot be simulated successfully if the ice in clouds is converted into liquid water. Both the albedo and the rate of change of albedo with ice fraction are significantly dependent on the method by which the phases are mixed; these factors may be of especial importance in climate-sensitivity experiments that incorporate mixed-phase clouds. The presence of ice in clouds below the cirrus level is often ignored in climate-model and radiation-budget studies. The calculations presented here indicate that this neglect may lead to a serious bias in cloud albedo for a given path of condensed water.},

Here we show that the ECS can be up to 1.3\textdegree C higher in simulations where mixed-phase clouds consisting of ice crystals and supercooled liquid droplets are constrained by global satellite observations.

Specifically, surface roughness and inhomogeneity are added to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) collection 6 (MC6) cirrus cloud particle habit model. Light scattering properties of the new habit model are simulated using a modified version of the Improved Geometric Optics Method (IGOM). Both inhomogeneity and surface roughness affect the single scattering properties significantly. In visible bands, inhomogeneity and surface roughness both tend to smooth the phase function and eliminate halos and the backscattering peak. The asymmetry parameter varies with the degree of surface roughness following a U shape - decreases and then increases - with a minimum at around 0.15, whereas it decreases monotonically with the air bubble volume fraction. Air bubble inclusions significantly increase phase matrix element -P12 for scattering angles between 20\textdegree\textendash 120\textdegree, whereas surface roughness has a much weaker effect, increasing -P12 slightly from 60\textdegree\textendash 120\textdegree. Radiative transfer simulations and cirrus cloud property retrievals are conducted by including both the factors. In terms of surface roughness and air bubble volume fraction, retrievals of cirrus cloud optical thickness or the asymmetry parameter using solar bands show similar patterns of variation. Polarimetric simulations using the MC6 cirrus cloud particle habit model are shown to be more consistent with observations when both surface roughness and inhomogeneity are simultaneously considered.},

Almost all series cover the standard normal period 1961 \textendash{} 90, and about 50\% extends back to atleast 1925. Part of the dataset (90\%) is made available for climate research on CDROM and through the Internet (athttp://www.knmi.nl/samenw/eca).A comparison of the ECA dataset with existing gridded datasets, having monthly resolution, shows that correlationcoefficients between ECA stations and nearest land grid boxes between 1946 and 1999 are higher than 0.8 for 93\% ofthe temperature series and for 51\% of the precipitation series. The overall trends in the ECA dataset are of comparablemagnitude to those in the gridded datasets.The potential of the ECA dataset for climate studies is demonstrated in two examples. In the first example, it is shownthat the winter (October \textendash{} March) warming in Europe in the 1976 \textendash{} 99 period is accompanied by a positive trend in thenumber of warm-spell days at most stations, but not by a negative trend in the number of cold-spell days. Instead, thenumber of cold-spell days increases over Europe. In the second example, it is shown for winter precipitation between1946 and 1999 that positive trends in the mean amount per wet day prevail in areas that are getting drier and wetter.Because of its daily resolution, the ECA dataset enables a variety of empirical climate studies, including detailedanalyses of changes in the occurrence of extremes in relation to changes in mean temperature and total precipitation.},

  abstract = {Abstract The shape of the drop size distribution (DSD) reflects the physics of rain. The DSD is the result of the microphysical processes that transform the condensed water into rain. The question of the DSD is also central in radar meteorology, because it rules the relationships between the radar reflectivity and the rainfall rate R. Normalizing raindrop spectra is the only way to identify the shape of the distribution. The concept of normalization of DSD developed in this paper is founded upon two reference variables, the liquid water content LWC and the mean volume diameter Dm. It is shown mathematically that it is appropriate to normalize by N0* {$\propto$} LWC/Dm4 with respect to particle concentration and by Dm with respect to drop diameter. Also, N0* may be defined as the intercept parameter that would have an exponential DSD with the same LWC and Dm as the real one. The major point of the authors' approach is that it is totally free of any assumption about the shape of the DSD. This new normalization has been applied to the airborne microphysical data of the Tropical Ocean and Global Atmosphere Coupled Ocean\textendash Atmosphere Response Experiment (TOGA COARE) collected by the National Center for Atmospheric Research Electra aircraft. The classification of the TOGA COARE raindrop spectra into four categories [one stratiform, and three convective (0\textendash 10, 10\textendash 30, and 30\textendash 100 mm h-1)] allowed the following features to be identified. 1)\hspace{0.6em}There is a distinct behavior of N0* between stratiform and convective rains; typical values are 2.2 \texttimes{} 106 m-4 for stratiform and 2 \texttimes{} 107 m-4 for convective. 2)\hspace{0.6em}In convective rain, there is a clear trend for Dm to increase with R, but there is no correlation between N0* and R. 3)\hspace{0.6em}The ``average'' normalized shape of the DSD is remarkably stable among the four rain categories. This normalized shape departs from the exponential, but also from all the analytical shapes considered up to now (e.g., gamma, lognormal, modified gamma). The stability of the normalized DSD shape and the physical variability of N0* and Dm are discussed in respect to the equilibrium theory of List et al. The stability of the shape implies that two parameters (and only two) are needed to describe the DSD. This stability supports the robustness of rain relations parameterized by N0*. The same TOGA COARE dataset is used to check that the rain relations parameterized by N0* are much less dispersed than the classical ones, even after rain-type classification.},

We present case studies of the boundary layer modi?cation and turbulent ?uxes over four wide leads, which differed strongly with respect to lead characteristics and environmental conditions. The observed near-surface sensible heat ?uxes ranged from 15 to 180 W m ?2 . The leads also induced an increase of the near-surface temperature of up to 3.2 ? C and a humidity increase of up to 0.2 g kg ?1 . In one of the cases, large entrainment ?uxes exceeding 30 \% of the surface ?uxes were observed. Vertical pro?les of turbulent sensible heat and momentum ?uxes were nonlinear downstream of the leads with a distinct ?ux maximum in the core of the convective plumes. In two cases, the plumes also strongly affected the wind ?eld within the atmospheric boundary layer. Low-level jets that existed in those cases in the region upstream of the leads disappeared in the plume region. Finally, it is shown that large errors can occur when ?ux measurements are derived from lead orthogonal ?ight legs only. Therefore, complex ?ight patterns, as presented in this study, are necessary to accurately determine the energy ?uxes in the environment of leads.},

Comparisons between short-wave reflectances simulated with the global forecasting configuration of the UM and observations from SEVIRI (Spin Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) on board Meteosat 8 are presented. One of the main purposes for such a comparison is model validation, since it allows us to directly compare model and satellite reflectances, without having to make use of retrieval systems. Eliminating the retrieval algorithm has the advantage that we can be certain that any discrepancies between the modelled and the measured radiances are due to inaccuracies in the model, rather than differences in the assumptions made both in the model and the retrieval algorithm. In principle, this should allow us to detect weaknesses in the model parametrizations. In particular, we compare the four short-wave channels of SEVIRI to the corresponding radiance simulations obtained from the UM over oceanic regions. Generally good agreement between the simulated and observed reflectances was obtained in the visible channels, but greater disagreement was found in the NIR 1.6 and IR 3.9 channels, hinting at deficiencies in the model's representation of particle size. Sensitivity studies are carried out to explore these sensitivities.},

  abstract = {Clouds are an important component of the earth's climate system. A better description of their microphysical properties is needed to improve radiative transfer calculations. In the framework of the Earth, Clouds, Aerosols, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission preparation, the radar\textendash lidar (RALI) airborne system, developed at L'Institut Pierre Simon Laplace (France), can be used as an airborne demonstrator. This paper presents an original method that combines cloud radar (94\textendash 95 GHz) and lidar data to derive the radiative and microphysical properties of clouds. It combines the apparent backscatter reflectivity from the radar and the apparent backscatter coefficient from the lidar. The principle of this algorithm relies on the use of a relationship between the extinction coefficient and the radar specific attenuation, derived from airborne microphysical data and Mie scattering calculations. To solve radar and lidar equations in the cloud region where signals can be obtained from both instruments, the extinction coefficients at some reference range z0 must be known. Because the algorithms are stable for inversion performed from range z0 toward the emitter, z0 is chosen at the farther cloud boundary as observed by the lidar. Then, making an assumption of a relationship between extinction coefficient and backscattering coefficient, the whole extinction coefficient, the apparent reflectivity, cloud physical parameters, the effective radius, and ice water content profiles are derived. This algorithm is applied to a blind test for downward-looking instruments where the original profiles are derived from in situ measurements. It is also applied to real lidar and radar data, obtained during the 1998 Cloud Lidar and Radar Experiment (CLARE'98) field project when a prototype airborne RALI system was flown pointing at nadir. The results from the synergetic algorithm agree reasonably well with the in situ measurements.},

  abstract = {Downwelling radiation in six regional models from the Arctic Regional Climate Model Intercomparison (ARCMIP) project is systematically biased negative in comparison with observations from the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean (SHEBA) experiment, although the correlations with observations are relatively good. In this paper, links between model errors and the representation of clouds in these models are investigated. Although some modeled cloud properties, such as the cloud water paths, are reasonable in a climatological sense, the temporal correlation of model cloud properties with observations is poor. The vertical distribution of cloud water is distinctly different among the different models; some common features also appear. Most models underestimate the presence of high clouds, and, although the observed preference for low clouds in the Arctic is present in most of the models, the modeled low clouds are too thin and are displaced downward. Practically all models show a preference to locate the lowest cloud base at the lowest model grid point. In some models this happens also to be where the observations show the highest occurrence of the lowest cloud base; it is not possible to determine if this result is just a coincidence. Different factors contribute to model surface radiation errors. For longwave radiation in summer, a negative bias is present both for cloudy and clear conditions, and intermodel differences are smaller when clouds are present. There is a clear relationship between errors in cloud-base temperature and radiation errors. In winter, in contrast, clear-sky cases are modeled reasonably well, but cloudy cases show a very large intermodel scatter with a significant bias in all models. This bias likely results from a complete failure in all of the models to retain liquid water in cold winter clouds. All models overestimate the cloud attenuation of summer solar radiation for thin and intermediate clouds, and some models maintain this behavior also for thick clouds.},

  abstract = {Forecasts with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' numerical weather prediction model are evaluated using an extensive set of observations from the Arctic Ocean 2018 expedition on the Swedish icebreaker Oden. The atmospheric model (Cy45r1) is similar to that used for the ERA5 reanalysis (Cy41r2). The evaluation covers 1 month, with the icebreaker moored to drifting sea ice near the North Pole; a total of 125 forecasts issued four times per day were used. Standard surface observations and 6-hourly soundings were assimilated to ensure that the initial model error is small. Model errors can be divided into two groups. First, variables related to dynamics feature errors that grow with forecast length; error spread also grows with time. Initial errors are small, facilitating a robust evaluation of the second group; thermodynamic variables. These feature fast error growth for 6\textendash 12 hr, after which errors saturates; error spread is roughly constant. Both surface and near-surface air temperatures are too warm in the model. During the summer both are typically above zero in spite of the ongoing melt; however, the warm bias increases as the surface freezes. The warm bias is due to a too warm atmosphere; errors in surface sensible heat flux transfer additional heat from the atmosphere to the surface. The lower troposphere temperature error has a distinct vertical structure: a substantial warm bias in the lowest few 100 m and a large cold bias around 1 km; this structure features a significant diurnal cycle and is tightly coupled to errors in the modelled clouds. Clouds appear too often and in a too deep layer of the lower atmosphere; the lowest clouds essentially never break up. The largest error in cloud presence is aligned with the largest cold bias at around 1 km.},

  abstract = {The perception about whether a place is a nice place to live often depends on how often it rains (or snows). The frequency relates to how dreary the weather appears, and it is the duration much more than the amount that clouds perceptions. Yet, information about the frequency of rainfall, or precipitation in general, is spotty at best. Here, we analyze a new near-global (60\textdegree N-60\textdegree S) dataset at hourly time scales and 0.25\textdegree{} resolution. The dataset, the newly calibrated Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH), enables comparison of results with 3-hourly and daily data, which is what has previously been available, and seasonal aspects are also examined. The results are quite sensitive to both the spatial scales of the data and their temporal resolutions, and it is important to get down to hourly values to gain a proper appreciation of the true frequency. At 1\textdegree resolution, values are 35 \% higher than for 0.25\textdegree. At 3-hourly resolution, they are about 25 \% higher than hourly, and at daily resolution, they are about 150 \% higher than hourly on average. Overall, near-global (60\textdegree N-60\textdegree S) precipitation occurs 11.0 \% {$\pm$} 1.1 \% (1 sigma) of the time or, alternatively, 89.0 \% of the time it is not precipitating. But outside of the intertropical and South Pacific convergence zones, where values exceed 30 \%, and the arid and desert regions, where values are below 4 \%, the rates are more like 10 \% or so, and over land where most people live, values are closer to about 8 \%.},

  abstract = {A novel technique based on Ka-W band dual-wavelength Doppler spectra has been developed for the simultaneous retrieval of binned rain drop size distributions (DSD) and air state parameters like vertical wind and air broadening caused by turbulence and wind shear. The rationale underpinning the method consists in exploiting the peculiar features observed in Doppler spectra caused by the wavelength dependence of scattering and absorption properties. A notional study based on a large data set of DSDs measured by a two-dimensional video disdrometer demonstrates that the retrieval performs best for small/moderate air broadening spectral width and when mean volume diameters exceed at least 1 mm. The retrieval is also limited to ranges below cloud base and where the signal-to-noise ratio of both radars exceed 10 dB, which rules out regions affected by strong attenuation. Broadly speaking, it is applicable to rain rates comprised between roughly 1 and 30 mm h-1. Preliminary retrieval for observations at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains site shows very good agreement with independent reflectivity measurements from a 0.915 GHz wind profiler. The proposed methodology shows great potential in linking microphysics to dynamics in rainfall studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract The link between stratiform precipitation microphysics and multifrequency radar observables is thoroughly investigated by exploiting simultaneous airborne radar and in situ observations collected from two aircraft during the OLYMPEX/RADEX (Olympic Mountain Experiment/Radar Definition Experiment 2015) field campaign. Above the melting level, in situ images and triple-frequency radar signatures both indicate the presence of moderately rimed aggregates. Various mass-size relationships of ice particles and snow scattering databases are used to compute the radar reflectivity from the in situ particle size distribution. At Ku and Ka band, the best agreement with radar observations is found when using the self-similar Rayleigh-Gans approximation for moderately rimed aggregates. At W band, a direct comparison is challenging because of the non-Rayleigh effects and of the probable attenuation due to ice aggregates and supercooled liquid water between the two aircraft. A variational method enables the retrieval of the full precipitation profile above and below the melting layer, by combining the observations from the three radars. Even with three radar frequencies, the retrieval of rain properties is challenging over land, where the integrated attenuation is not available. Otherwise, retrieved mean volume diameters and water contents of both solid and liquid precipitation are in agreement with in situ observations and indicate local changes of the degree of riming of ice aggregates, on the scale of 5 km. Finally, retrieval results are analyzed to explore the validity of using continuity constraints on the water mass flux and diameter within the melting layer in order to improve retrievals of ice properties.},

  abstract = {Radiative transfer modeling through cloudy atmospheres requires accurate measurement of the cloud properties. In liquid water clouds, accurate measurements of the liquid water path (LWP) are required, especially when the LWP is less than 100 g/m2. A new ground-based retrieval algorithm was developed that retrieves LWP using infrared (8\textendash 13 {$\mu$}m and 3\textendash 4 {$\mu$}m) and microwave (23.8 and 31.4 GHz) radiance observations, as microwave radiance is sensitive to a large range of LWP (less than 5 to over 1000 g/m2) and infrared radiance is extremely sensitive to LWP less than approximately 60 g/m2. The random error in the retrieved LWP is estimated to be less than 4\% when the LWP is less than 50 g/m2 but, for larger LWPs, it increases to at least 12 g/m2. The algorithm is also able to retrieve effective radius (re) when the LWP is less than approximately 60 g/m2. This new retrieval algorithm was applied to data collected by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program's Mobile Facility at Pt. Reyes, California, from July to August 2005. Daytime retrieved re values agree well to airborne in situ observations, with a mean bias of 0.11 {$\mu$}m. A radiative transfer model utilizing the retrieved cloud properties was used to compute the surface and top of the atmosphere fluxes. The flux residuals (observed minus calculated) demonstrate a significant reduction in scatter (approximately a factor of 2 for LWP {$<$} 40 g/m2) relative to flux calculations where the cloud properties were determined by the microwave-only retrieval algorithm MWRRET.},

  abstract = {Abstract This paper examines the processes through which cloud heterogeneities influence solar reflection. This question is important since present methods give numerical results only for the overall radiative effect of cloud heterogeneities but cannot determine the degree to which various mechanisms are responsible for it. This study establishes a theoretical framework that defines these mechanisms and also provides a procedure to calculate their magnitude. In deriving the framework, the authors introduce a one-dimensional radiative transfer approximation, called the tilted independent pixel approximation (TIPA). TIPA uses the horizontal distribution of slant optical thicknesses along the direct solar beam to describe the radiative influence of cloud heterogeneities when horizontal transport between neighbors is not considered. The effects for horizontal transport are then attributed to two basic mechanisms: trapping and escape of radiation, when it moves to thicker and thinner cloud elements, respectively. Using the proposed framework, the study examines the shortwave radiative effects of cloud-top height and cloud volume extinction coefficient variations. It is shown and explained that identical variations in cloud optical thickness can cause much stronger heterogeneity effects if they are due to variations in geometrical cloud thickness rather than in volume extinction coefficient. The differences in albedo can exceed 0.05, and the relative differences in reflectance toward the zenith can be greater than 25\% for overhead sun and 50\% for oblique sun. The paper also explains a previously observed phenomenon: it shows that the trapping of upwelling radiation causes the zenith reflectance of heterogeneous clouds to increase with decreasing solar elevation.},

The observations suggest that strong cloud top cooling was necessary to produce the well-mixed cloud layers; clouds shielded from radiative cooling by overlaying clouds more frequently existed in absolutely stable layers. The in situ measurements revealed that most liquid layers contained drizzle, the production process of which was shown from the radar and lidar measurements to have been interrupted only during heavier ice-precipitation events. Different layers interacted with one another by changing the radiative heating profile and by precipitation which changed the growth paths available to cloud particles and even initiated new hydrometeor classes.},

  abstract = {When the ARM Program embarked on its quest to select sites for the proposed ground-based atmospheric observatories, there was a broad consensus that more than one site was needed. One site had to be in the equatorial regions, where a disproportionate share of the solar energy fueling Earth?s atmospheric general circulation is received, and the other in a polar location, where radiant energy lost to space greatly exceeds the energy received by the sun. While the latitudinal energy imbalance suggested a polar site, an Arctic location was preferred, because the Arctic plays a stronger role in the general circulation than does the Antarctic (Crowley and North 1991). As far back as 1896, the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius suggested that changes in Earth?s atmospheric composition would lead to faster changes in the Arctic compared to the rest of the globe (Arrhenius 1896), a process con?rmed by general circulation models and now called Arctic ampli?cation [e.g., see summary in Serreze and Barry (2011)]. The high sensitivity of the Arctic to climate change is a result of the susceptibility of the cryosphere (sea ice, land ice, and permafrost) to changes in energy ?uxes and in?uential feedback processes. For example, over the Arctic sea ice, the strong sea ice?albedo feedback ampli?es the observed decline in ice extent (e.g., Wendler et al. 2010). Faster changes in the Arctic relative to lower latitudes disturb the latitudinal energy balance and, hence, the general circulation patterns in both the oceans and atmosphere, impacting the entire globe. It may be said that what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic! Low temperatures in the Arctic result in low water vapor mixing ratios in the atmosphere, low enough that additional spectral regions, such as the water vapor rotational absorption bands in Earth?s emission spectrum, become semitransparent in the cloudless atmosphere, increasing radiative energy losses from the surface (Stamnes et al. 1999). The presence of clouds in the atmosphere alters the atmospheric radiative absorption spectrum and thus has a strong in?uence on the surface energy budget and radiative losses to space. Most Arctic clouds are found in the lower troposphere, where they interact with strong and persistent near-surface temperature inversions, a characteristic of the Arctic environment (Serreze et al. 1992). Most of the uncertainties in the Arctic radiation budget are associated with an incomplete understanding of the process interactions between Earth?s surface and the atmosphere through this interfacial layer. Complex interactions involving surface?atmosphere energy and water vapor exchange, multiphase cloud processes, the strati?ed lower troposphere, and radiative energy pro?les combine to make the high latitudes challenging to represent accurately in numerical weather prediction and climate models. These challenges together motivated the ARM Program to establish an Arctic observatory to study the many processes that regulate the ?ow of radiative energy through the atmospheric system.},

  abstract = {AbstractA new ice cloud optical property database in the thermal infrared has been parameterized for the RTTOV radiative transfer model. The Self-Consistent Scattering Model (SCSM) database is based on an ensemble model of ice crystals and a parameterization of the particle size distribution. This convolution can predict the radiative properties of cirrus without the need of a priori information on the ice particle shape and an estimate of the ice crystal effective dimension. The ice cloud optical properties are estimated through linear parameterizations of ambient temperature and ice water content. We evaluate the new parameterization against existing parameterizations used in RTTOV. We compare infrared observations from Imaging Infrared Radiometer, on board CALIPSO, against RTTOV simulations of the observations. The simulations are performed using two different products of ice cloud profiles, retrieved from the synergy between space-based radar and lidar observations. These are the 2C-ICE and DARDAR products. We optimized the parameterization by testing different SCSM databases, derived from different shapes of the particle size distribution, and weighting the volume extinction coefficient of the ensemble model. By selecting a large global data set of ice cloud profiles of visible optical depths between 0.03 and 4, we found that the simulations, based on the optimized SCSM database parameterization, reproduces the observations with a mean bias of only 0.43 K and a standard deviation of 6.85 K. The optimized SCSM database parameterization can also be applied to any other radiative transfer model.},

  abstract = {The current assessment of the Antarctic surface mass balance mostly relies on reanalysis products or climate model simulations. However, little is known about the ability of models to reliably represent the microphysical processes governing the precipitation. This study makes use of recent ground-based precipitation measurements at Dumont d'Urville station in Adelie Land to evaluate the representation of the precipitation microphysics in the Polar version of the eather Research Forecast (Polar WRF) atmospheric model. During two summertime snowfall events, high-resolution simulations are compared to measurements from an X-band polarimetric radar and from a Multi-Angle Snowflake Camera (MASC). A radar simulator and a ``MASC'' simulator in Polar WRF make it possible to compare similar observed and simulated variables. Radiosoundings and surface-meteorological observations were used to assess the representation of the regional dynamics in the model. Five different microphysical parameterizations are tested. The simulated temperature, wind, and humidity fields are in good agreement with the observations. However, the amount of simulated surface precipitation shows large discrepancies with respect to observations, and it strongly differs between the simulations themselves, evidencing the critical role of the microphysics. The inspection of vertical profiles of reflectivity and mixing ratios revealed that the representation of the sublimation process by the low-level dry katabatic winds strongly influences the actual amount of precipitation at the ground surface. By comparing the simulated radar signal as well as MASC and model particle size distributions, it is also possible to identify the microphysical processes involved and to pinpoint shortcomings within the tested parameterizations.},

During and since the International Polar Year 2007\textendash 2009, significant advances have been made in understanding these processes. Here, these recent advances are reviewed, synthesized, and discussed. In atmospheric physics, the primary advances have been in cloud physics, radiative transfer, mesoscale cyclones, coastal, and fjordic processes as well as in boundary layer processes and surface fluxes. In sea ice and its snow cover, advances have been made in understanding of the surface albedo and its relationships with snow properties, the internal structure of sea ice, the heat and salt transfer in ice, the formation of superimposed ice and snow ice, and the small-scale dynamics of sea ice. For the ocean, significant advances have been related to exchange processes at the ice\textendash ocean interface, diapycnal mixing, double-diffusive convection, tidal currents and diurnal resonance. Despite this recent progress, some of these small-scale physical processes are still not sufficiently understood: these include wave\textendash turbulence interactions in the atmosphere and ocean, the exchange of heat and salt at the ice\textendash ocean interface, and the mechanical weakening of sea ice. Many other processes are reasonably well understood as stand-alone processes but the challenge is to understand their interactions with and impacts and feedbacks on other processes. Uncertainty in the parameterization of small-scale processes continues to be among the greatest challenges facing climate modelling, particularly in high latitudes. Further improvements in parameterization require new year-round field campaigns on the Arctic sea ice, closely combined with satellite remote sensing studies and numerical model experiments.},

  abstract = {The areal extent, concentration and thickness of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean and adjacent seas have strongly decreased during the recent decades, but cold, snow-rich winters have been common over mid-latitude land areas since 2005. A review is presented on studies addressing the local and remote effects of the sea ice decline on weather and climate. It is evident that the reduction in sea ice cover has increased the heat flux from the ocean to atmosphere in autumn and early winter. This has locally increased air temperature, moisture, and cloud cover and reduced the static stability in the lower troposphere. Several studies based on observations, atmospheric reanalyses, and model experiments suggest that the sea ice decline, together with increased snow cover in Eurasia, favours circulation patterns resembling the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation and Arctic Oscillation. The suggested large-scale pressure patterns include a high over Eurasia, which favours cold winters in Europe and northeastern Eurasia. A high over the western and a low over the eastern North America have also been suggested, favouring advection of Arctic air masses to North America. Mid-latitude winter weather is, however, affected by several other factors, which generate a large inter-annual variability and often mask the effects of sea ice decline. In addition, the small sample of years with a large sea ice loss makes it difficult to distinguish the effects directly attributable to sea ice conditions. Several studies suggest that, with advancing global warming, cold winters in mid-latitude continents will no longer be common during the second half of the twenty-first century. Recent studies have also suggested causal links between the sea ice decline and summer precipitation in Europe, the Mediterranean, and East Asia.},

The broad range of issues related to these interactions, and to three-dimensional interactions in particular, has motivated the development of accurate radiative tools able to compute all types of radiative metrics, from monochromatic, local, and directional observables to integrated energetic quantities. Building on this community effort, we present here an open-source library for general use in Monte Carlo algorithms. This library is devoted to the acceleration of ray tracing in complex data, typically high-resolution large-domain grounds and clouds. The main algorithmic advances embedded in the library are related to the construction and traversal of hierarchical grids accelerating the tracing of paths through heterogeneous fields in null-collision (maximum cross-section) algorithms. We show that with these hierarchical grids, the computing time is only weakly sensitive to the refinement of the volumetric data. The library is tested with a rendering algorithm that produces synthetic images of cloud radiances. Other examples of implementation are provided to demonstrate potential uses of the library in the context of 3-D radiation studies and parameterization development, evaluation, and tuning.},

Using a vertically pointing Doppler X-band radar, cases can be separated into one of three groups: unrimed to lightly rimed, riming with no bimodal spectra and fall speeds greater than 2.0 m s-1, and riming with bimodal velocity spectra. By averaging polarimetric variables over a 20\textdegree{} by 10-km box near the X-band radar, different signatures were documented for each of the three groups. These polarimetric signatures were then compared with a simplified T-matrix scattering model. Differential reflectivity ZDR was the one polarimetric variable to consistently vary across all three groups. Unrimed to lightly rimed cases had profiles of polarimetric signatures similar to numerous previous studies. Riming cases without detectable bimodal spectra had ZDR values on the order of 0.2 dB lower than unrimed to lightly rimed cases, while cases with bimodal spectra had ZDR values about 0.2\textendash 0.4 dB higher than unrimed to lightly rimed cases. Both signatures were reproduced using populations of aggregates, dendrites, and needles in the T-matrix scattering model. While these signatures show the potential to identify riming, they are not enough larger than measurement biases and case-to-case variability to be confidently used without confirmation from other data sources, such as a vertically pointing radar.},

Direct observations of cirrus properties and their variability are still incomplete, currently limiting our understanding of the clouds' impact on climate. Also, dynamical effects on clouds and feedbacks are not adequately represented in today's weather prediction models.Here, we present the rationale, objectives, and selected scientific highlights of ML-CIRRUS using the G-550 aircraft of the German atmospheric science community. The first combined in situ\textendash remote sensing cloud mission with HALO united state-of-the-art cloud probes, a lidar and novel ice residual, aerosol, trace gas, and radiation instrumentation. The aircraft observations were accompanied by remote sensing from satellite and ground and by numerical simulations.In spring 2014, HALO performed 16 flights above Europe with a focus on anthropogenic contrail cirrus and midlatitude cirrus induced by frontal systems including warm conveyor belts and other dynamical regimes (jet streams, mountain waves, and convection). Highlights from ML-CIRRUS include 1) new observations of microphysical and radiative cirrus properties and their variability in meteorological regimes typical for midlatitudes, 2) insights into occurrence of in situ\textendash formed and lifted liquid-origin cirrus, 3) validation of cloud forecasts and satellite products, 4) assessment of contrail predictability, and 5) direct observations of contrail cirrus and their distinction from natural cirrus. Hence, ML-CIRRUS provides a comprehensive dataset on cirrus in the densely populated European midlatitudes with the scope to enhance our understanding of cirrus clouds and their role for climate and weather.},

The measurements provide important information on the coupling of the ocean and ice surface to the atmosphere and in particular to clouds. This paper provides (i) an overview of the synoptic-scale atmospheric conditions and their climatological anomaly to help interpret the process studies and put the detailed observations from AO2018 into a larger context, both spatially and temporally; (ii) a statistical analysis of the thermodynamic and near-surface meteorological conditions, boundary layer, cloud, and fog characteristics; and (iii) a comparison of the results to observations from earlier Arctic Ocean expeditions \textendash{} in particular AOE1996 (Arctic Ocean Expedition 1996), SHEBA (Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean), AOE2001 (Arctic Ocean Experiment 2001), ASCOS (Arctic Summer Cloud Ocean Study), ACSE (Arctic Clouds in Summer Experiment), and AO2016 (Arctic Ocean 2016) \textendash{} to provide an assessment of the representativeness of the measurements. The results show that near-surface conditions were broadly comparable to earlier experiments; however the thermodynamic vertical structure was quite different.

Instead, an unexpectedly high amount of multiple cloud layers and mid-level clouds were present throughout the campaign. These differences from previous studies are related to the high frequency of cyclonic activity in the central Arctic in 2018.},

We evaluate the meteorological and sea ice conditions during the campaign based on the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5), satellite data, and atmospheric soundings with respect to climatology and describe special synoptic events. HALO\&ndash;(AC)\&sup3; started with a warm period (11\&ndash;20 March) where strong southerly winds prevailed that caused moist and warm air intrusions (MWAIs). Two MWAIs were detected as Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). Compared to the ERA5 climatology (1979\&ndash;2022), record breaking vertically integrated poleward heat and moisture fluxes averaged over 75.0\&ndash;81.5\&deg; N were found. The related warm and moist air masses reached the central Arctic, causing the highest rainfall rates over the sea ice northwest of Svalbard recorded since the beginning of the ERA5 climatology. Subsequently, the cold period of HALO\&ndash;(AC)\&sup3; started after the passage of a Shapiro\&ndash;Keyser cyclone on 21 March when the wind regime turned to northerlies, advecting colder air into the Fram Strait. Until 08 April, marine cold air outbreaks (MCAOs) prevailed, including two strong MCAO events on 21\&ndash;26 March and 01\&ndash;02 April. In between, aged subpolar warm air was advected to the Fram Strait with northeasterly and easterly winds. On average, the campaign period was warmer than the climatology, especially due to the exceptionally strong ARs during the warm period. In the Fram Strait, the sea ice concentration (SIC) was within the 10\&ndash;90\textsuperscript{th} percentiles of the climatology over the entire campaign duration. During the warm period, SIC was strongly reduced and an untypically large polynya for this season opened north of Svalbard. During the cold period, the polynya was closed again and above average SICs were found. We describe the environmental conditions of a Polar Low and far north reaching cirrus in detail, which will be subjects of research using HALO's remote sensing suite in the future. We also present the perspective on the HALO\&ndash;(AC)\&sup3; weather conditions from the research site Ny\&ndash;\&Aring;lesund, where orographic effects caused by the Svalbard archipelago and temporal shifts of atmospheric signals due to the propagation of synoptic systems must be taken into account. Overall, our study may serve as basis for future analyses of the data collected during HALO\&ndash;(AC)\&sup3; and to compare synoptic conditions with other field campaigns.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Optical and microphysical properties for optically thin ice clouds are retrieved from one year of collocated Aqua/MODIS and CALIPSO/CALIOP measurements in 2008. The values of optical thickness {$\tau$} and effective particle size Deff are inferred from MODIS measurements at three infrared (IR) bands located at 8.5, 11, and 12\textmu m in conjunction with collocated CALIOP cloud boundary altitudes and the MERRA atmospheric profile datasets. The {$\tau$} values inferred from MODIS IR window measurements are insensitive to the pre-assumed particle and habit distributions. Based on near-IR measurements at 1.38{$\mu$}m and the IR-based {$\tau$}, a new method is developed to infer the scattering phase functions over both ocean and land. A comparison between theoretically calculated phase functions and the retrieved counterparts demonstrates that roughened solid columns provide the best match for cirrus clouds over ocean, whereas droxtals may exist in optically thin cirrus clouds. The best-fitted phase functions are generated using appropriate habit mixtures to match the inferred phase functions. The phase function resulting from a mixture of 55\% severely roughened solid columns, 35\% severely roughened droxtals, and 10\% smooth aggregates almost perfectly matches the mean phase function value retrieved over ocean. The asymmetry factor based on the oceanic best-fitted phase functions is 0.778 at a wavelength of 0.65{$\mu$}m. However, it is difficult to find an appropriate habit recipe to fit the inferred phase function over land. This may be caused by the relatively large uncertainties associated with {$\tau$} retrievals over land. The retrieval of Deff shows that optically thin cirrus clouds consist of smaller ice particles in comparison with optically thicker ice clouds. The mean Deff values of optically thin ice clouds over land and ocean are 41{$\mu$}m and 48{$\mu$}m, respectively.},

Globally, of total observations, C-C reports 27.1\% clear and 72.9\% cloudy, whereas MODIS reports 30.0\% confidently clear and 58.7\% confidently cloudy, with the rest 7.1\% as probably clear and 4.2\% as probably cloudy. Agreement between MODIS and C-C is 77.8\%, with 20.9\% showing both clear and 56.9\% showing both cloudy. The 9.1\% of observations are clear in MODIS but cloudy in C-C, indicating clouds missed by MODIS; 1.8\% of observations are cloudy in MODIS but clear in C-C, likely due to aerosol/dust or surface snow layers misidentified by MODIS. C-C reports 47.4/25.5\% single-layer/multilayer clouds, while MODIS reports 26.7/14.0\%. For C-C single-layer clouds, 90\% of tropical MODIS high (CTP {$<$} 440 hPa) and optically thin ({$\tau$} {$<$} 3.6) clouds are identified as cirrus and 60\% of high and optically thick ({$\tau$} {$>$} 23) clouds are recognized as deep convective in C-C. Approximately 70\% of MODIS low-level (CTP {$>$} 680 hPa) clouds are classified as stratocumulus in C-C regardless of region and optical thickness. No systematic relationship exists between MODIS middle-level (680 {$<$} CTP {$<$} 440 hPa) clouds and C-C cloud types, largely due to different definitions adopted.},

  abstract = {We diagnose climate feedback parameters and CO2 forcing including rapid adjustment in twelve atmosphere/mixed-layer-ocean (``slab'') climate models from the CMIP3/CFMIP-1 project (the AR4 ensemble) and fifteen parameter-perturbed versions of the HadSM3 slab model (the PPE). In both ensembles, differences in climate feedbacks can account for approximately twice as much of the range in climate sensitivity as differences in CO2 forcing. In the AR4 ensemble, cloud effects can explain the full range of climate sensitivities, and cloud feedback components contribute four times as much as cloud components of CO2 forcing to the range. Non-cloud feedbacks are required to fully account for the high sensitivities of some models however. The largest contribution to the high sensitivity of HadGEM1 is from a high latitude clear-sky shortwave feedback, and clear-sky longwave feedbacks contribute substantially to the highest sensitivity members of the PPE. Differences in low latitude ocean regions (30\textdegree N/S) contribute more to the range than those in mid-latitude oceans (30\textendash 55\textdegree N/S), low/mid latitude land (55\textdegree N/S) or high latitude ocean/land (55\textendash 90\textdegree N/S), but contributions from these other regions are required to account fully for the higher model sensitivities, for example from land areas in IPSL CM4. Net cloud feedback components over the low latitude oceans sorted into percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS) show largest differences among models in stable regions, mainly due to their shortwave components, most of which are positive in spite of increasing LTS. Differences in the mid-stability range are smaller, but cover a larger area, contributing a comparable amount to the range in climate sensitivity. These are strongly anti-correlated with changes in subsidence. Cloud components of CO2 forcing also show the largest differences in stable regions, and are strongly anticorrelated with changes in estimated inversion strength (EIS). This is qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from observed relationships between EIS and low-level cloud fraction. We identify a number of cases where individual models show unusually strong forcings and feedbacks compared to other members of the ensemble. We encourage modelling groups to investigate unusual model behaviours further with sensitivity experiments. Most of the models fail to correctly reproduce the observed relationships between stability and cloud radiative effect in the subtropics, indicating that there remains considerable room for model improvements in the future.},

  abstract = {An airborne albedometer including a low-cost, precise, and fast sensor head horizontal stabilization system was developed to measure spectral down- and upward irradiances between 400- and 1000-nm wavelength. It is installed on a small research aircraft (type Partenavia P68-B), but it can easily be mounted on other aircraft as well. The stabilization unit keeps the two radiation sensor heads (up- and downward looking) of the albedometer in a horizontal position during the flight with an accuracy of better than {$\pm$}0.2\textdegree{} over a range of pitch and roll angles of {$\pm$}6\textdegree. The system works properly for angular velocities up to 3\textdegree{} s-1 with a response time of the horizontal adjustment of 43 ms. Thus it can be applied even under turbulent atmospheric conditions. The limitations of the stabilization have been determined by laboratory and in-flight performance tests. As a result it is found that the new horizontal stabilization system ensures that misalignment-related uncertainties of the measured irradiances are less than 1\% for solar zenith angles up to 70\textdegree. This does not include uncertainties due to deviations from the ideal cosine response of the optical inlet system and measurement errors resulting from absolute calibration problems. An example of downward spectral irradiances measured under cloudless conditions above and within a distinct boundary layer with enhanced aerosol particle concentrations shows the potential of the new instrument for improved radiative budget measurements in the atmosphere.},

The data were gathered in cloudless, hazy conditions over sea and land using a new instrument (called albedometer), which is equipped with a unique sensor head leveling technique. The downwelling irradiances and their spectral slope increase with altitude, illustrating the impact of Rayleigh scattering and boundary layer aerosols. The upwelling spectra reveal typical reflection features of the underlying surface (e.g., vegetation step around 700 nm). The measurements are compared with radiative transfer model results based on simultaneous airborne aerosol observations. The downwelling irradiances mostly agree to {$\pm$}10\% which is within the experimental and modeling uncertainties. The upwelling irradiances are highly sensitive to uncertainties in the spectral surface albedo. Reasonable agreement between measurements and simulations required us to determine the surface albedo from flights at low altitude, rather than adopting literature values.},

  abstract = {Profiles of in situ measurements of ice crystal size distribution of subtropical cirrus were used to calculate solar spectral irradiances above and below the clouds. Spheres and nonspherical ice crystal habits (columns, hollows, plates, bullets, and aggregates) were assumed in the calculations. The simulation results were compared to irradiance measurements from the NASA Solar Spectral Flux Radiometer. The microphysical and radiation data were collected by three aircraft during CRYSTAL-FACE. Two cirrus cases (optical thickness of about 1 and 7) from two mission dates (26 and 23 July 2002) were investigated in detail. The measured downwelling and upwelling irradiance spectra above the cirrus could mostly be reproduced by the radiation model to within {$\pm$}5\textendash 10\% for most ice crystal habits. Below the cirrus the simulations disagreed with the measured irradiances due to surface albedo variability along the flight track, and nonoptimal colocation between the microphysical and irradiance measurements. The impact of shape characteristics of the crystals was important for the reflected irradiances above the optically thin cirrus, especially for small solar zenith angles, because in this case single-scattering dominated the solar radiation field. For the cirrus of moderate optical thickness the enhanced multiple scattering tended to diminish particular shape features caused by nonspherical single-scattering. Within the ice absorption bands the shape-related differences in the absorption characteristics of the individual nonspherical ice crystals were amplified if multiple scattering prevailed. Furthermore, it was found that below the cloud the shape sensitivity of the downwelling irradiance spectra is larger compared to the nonsphericity effects on reflected irradiances above the cirrus. Finally, it was shown that the calculated cirrus solar radiative forcing could vary by as much as 26\% depending on the ice crystal habit.},

  abstract = {The impact of assumed ice crystal morphology on thermal infrared (IR) radiative properties of subtropical cirrus is quantified. In particular, the crystal-shape-dependent profiles of downwelling and upwelling thermal IR (broadband and spectral) irradiances and the radiative forcing of cirrus (at the top and bottom of the atmosphere) are investigated. For this purpose, airborne measurements of ice crystal size distribution (in terms of ice crystal maximum dimension) from the CRYSTAL-FACE campaign and a recently published library of thermal IR optical properties of nonspherical ice crystal habits are implemented into radiative transfer simulations. Two cirrus cases are studied in detail: (1) a high (cold) cirrus with small optical thickness ({$\approx$}1 at 10.8 {$\mu$}m wavelength) and (2) a lower (warmer) cirrus of relatively large optical thickness ({$\approx$}7). The relative effects of ice crystal shape on thermal IR irradiance are substantial for the high, optically thin cirrus (up to 70\%). Spectrally, the largest effects of ice crystal shape are identified in the atmospheric window spanning from 8 to 12 {$\mu$}m wavelengths, especially for the upwelling irradiance above the cirrus. For the low cirrus of large optical thickness the thermal IR irradiance is only slightly sensitive to ice crystal habit (less than 15\textendash 20\%). Within the major gas absorption bands the thermal IR radiation is essentially insensitive to ice crystal shape. Furthermore, it is concluded that the thermal IR radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere contains significant ice crystal shape dependence for the high cirrus case.},

  abstract = {A consortium of polar scientists combined observational forces in a field campaign of unprecedented complexity to uncover the secrets of clouds and their role in Arctic amplification. Two research aircraft, an icebreaker research vessel, an ice-floe camp including an instrumented tethered balloon, and a permanent ground-based measurement station were employed in this endeavour. Clouds play an important role in Arctic amplification. This term represents the recently observed enhanced warming of the Arctic relative to the global increase of near-surface air temperature. However, there are still important knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between Arctic clouds and aerosol particles, surface properties, as well as turbulent and radiative fluxes that inhibit accurate model simulations of clouds in the Arctic climate system. In an attempt to resolve this so-called Arctic cloud puzzle, two comprehensive and closely coordinated field studies were conducted: the ''Arctic CLoud Observations Using airborne measurements during polar Day (ACLOUD)'' aircraft campaign, and the ''Physical feedbacks of Arctic boundary layer, Sea ice, Cloud and AerosoL (PASCAL)'' ice breaker expedition. Both observational studies were performed in the framework of the German ''ArctiC Amplification:Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes, and Feedback Mechanisms (AC)3'' project. They took place in the vicinity of Svalbard (Norway) in May and June 2017. ACLOUD and PASCAL explored four pieces of the Arctic cloud puzzle: Cloud properties, aerosol impact on clouds, atmospheric radiation, and turbulent-dynamical processes. The two instrumented Polar 5 and Polar 6 aircraft, the icebreaker research vessel (RV) Polarstern, an ice-floe camp including an instrumented tethered balloon, and the permanent, ground-based measurement station at Ny-\AA lesund (Svalbard) were employed to observe Arctic low and mid-level, mixed-phase clouds, and to investigate related atmospheric and surface processes. The Polar 5 aircraft served as a remote sensing observatory examining the clouds from above by downward-looking sensors; the Polar 6 aircraft operated as a flying in-situ measurement laboratory sampling inside and below the clouds. Most of the collocated Polar 5/6 flights were conducted either above RV Polarstern or over the Ny-\AA lesund station, both of which monitored the clouds from below using similar but upward-looking remote sensing techniques as the Polar 5 aircraft. Several of the flights were carried out underneath collocated satellite tracks. The paper motivates the scientific objectives of the ACLOUD/PASCAL observations and describes the measured quantities, retrieved parameters, and the applied complementary instrumentation. Furthermore, it discusses selected measurement results, and poses critical research questions to be answered in future papers analyzing the data from the two field campaigns.},

  abstract = {Mechanisms behind the phenomenon of Arctic amplification are widely discussed. To contribute to this debate, the (AC)3 project has been established in 2016 (http://www.ac3-tr.de/). It comprises modeling and data analysis efforts as well as observational elements. The project has assembled a wealth of ground-based, airborne, ship-borne, and satellite data of physical, chemical, and meteorological properties of the Arctic atmosphere, cryosphere, and upper ocean that are available for the Arctic climate research community. Short-term changes and indications of long-term trends in Arctic climate parameters have been detected using existing and new data. For example, a distinct atmospheric moistening, an increase of regional storm activities, an amplified winter warming in the Svalbard and North Pole regions, and a decrease of sea ice thickness in the Fram Strait and of snow depth on sea ice have been identified. A positive trend of tropospheric bromine monoxide (BrO) column densities during polar spring was verified. Local marine/biogenic sources for cloud condensation nuclei and ice nucleating particles were found. Atmospheric/ocean and radiative transfer models were advanced by applying new parameterizations of surface albedo, cloud droplet activation, convective plumes and related processes over leads, and turbulent transfer coefficients for stable surface layers. Four modes of the surface radiative energy budget were explored and reproduced by simulations. To advance the future synthesis of the results, cross cutting activities are being developed aiming to answer key questions in four focus areas: lapse rate feedback, surface processes, Arctic mixed-phase clouds, and air mass transport and transformation.},

  abstract = {Based on the radiative transfer theory, the microwave radiance emanating from ice clouds at arbitrary viewing angles is expressed as an analytic function of the cloud ice water path (IWP), the particle effective diameter (De), and the particle bulk density ({$\rho$}i). Thus, for a given particle density, the earth-viewing measurements at two frequencies (e.g., 340 and 89 GHz) can provide an estimate of De and IWP for submillimeter-size particles. This physical retrieval is tested using data from the Millimeter-wave Imaging Radiometer (MIR). A comparison among MIR, radar, and infrared sensor measurements shows that the MIR frequencies are affected primarily by thick ice clouds such as cirrus anvil and convection. Over highly convective areas, the measurements from 89 to 220 GHz are nearly identical since the scattering by large ice particles aloft approaches the geometric optics limit, which is independent of wavelength. Under these conditions, only the lower MIR frequencies (89 and 150 GHz) are used to retrieve De and IWP. In general, the MIR-derived De displays a reasonable spatial distribution comparable to the radar and infrared measurements. However, the magnitude of the IWP remains highly uncertain because of insufficient information on the ice particle bulk density.},

In situ cirrus has no LWC along the trajectory segment containing IWC; it forms via nucleation from the gas phase. In contrast, liquid-origin cirrus has both LWC and IWC along their backward trajectories; it forms via lifting from the lower troposphere and freezing of mixed-phase clouds. This classification is applied to 12 years of ERA-Interim ice clouds in the North Atlantic region. Between 400 and 500 hPa more than 50\% are liquid-origin cirrus, whereas this frequency decreases strongly with altitude ({$<$}10\% at 200 hPa). The relative frequencies of the two categories vary only weakly with season. More than 50\% of in situ cirrus occur on top of liquid-origin cirrus, indicating that they often form in response to the strong lifting accompanying the formation of liquid-origin cirrus.},

At colder temperatures, there is a monotonic decline in the fraction of liquid-topped ice clouds: 50\% at -27\textdegree C, falling to zero at -37\textdegree C (where homogeneous freezing of water droplets occurs). This strongly suggests that deposition nucleation plays a relatively minor role in the initiation of ice in mid-level clouds.

  abstract = {This study presents and applies three separate processing methods to improve high-order moments estimated from 35GHz (Ka band) vertically pointing radar Doppler velocity spectra. The first processing method removes Doppler-shifted ground clutter from spectra collected by a US Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program Ka-band zenith pointing radar (KAZR) deployed at Oliktok Point (OLI), Alaska. Ground clutter resulted from multiple pathways through antenna side lobes and reflections off a rotating scanning radar antenna located 2m away from KAZR, which caused Doppler shifts in ground clutter returns from stationary targets 2.5km away. After removing clutter in the recorded velocity spectra, the second processing method identifies multiple separate and sub-peaks in the spectra and estimates high-order moments for each peak. Multiple peaks and high-order moments were estimated for both original 2 and 15s averaged spectra. The third processing step improves the spectrum variance, skewness, and kurtosis estimates by removing velocity variability due to turbulent broadening during 15s averaging intervals. Applying the multiple peak processing to Doppler velocity spectra during liquid-only clouds can identify cloud and drizzle particles and during mixed-phase clouds can identify liquid cloud and frozen hydrometeors. Consistent with previous studies, this work found that spectrum skewness assuming only a single spectral peak was a good indicator of two hydrometeor populations (for example, cloud and drizzle particles) being present in the radar pulse volume. Yet, after dividing the spectrum into multiple peaks, velocity spectrum skewness for individual peaks is near zero, indicating nearly symmetric peaks. This suggests that future studies should use velocity skewness of single-peak spectra as an indicator of possible multiple hydrometeor populations and then use multiple-peak moments for quantitative studies. Three future activities will continue this work. First, KAZR spectra from several ARM sites have been processed and are available in the ARM archive as a principal investigator (PI) product. ARM programmers are evaluating these processing methods as part of future multiple-peak products generated by ARM. Third, MATLAB code generating the Oliktok Point products has been uploaded as supplemental material for public dissemination.},

They play a crucial role in surface heat loss, potential ice formation and consequently in the seasonal sea-ice budget. While polynyas are generally sufficiently large to be observed with passive microwave satellite sensors, the monitoring of narrow leads requires the use of data at a higher spatial resolution. We apply and evaluate different lead segmentation techniques based on sea-ice surface temperatures as measured by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). Daily lead composite maps indicate the presence of cloud artifacts that arise from ambiguities in the segmentation process and shortcomings in the MODIS cloud mask. A fuzzy cloud artifact filter is hence implemented to mitigate these effects and the associated potential misclassification of leads. The filter is adjusted with reference data from thermal infrared image sequences, and applied to daily MODIS data from January to April 2008. The daily lead product can be used to deduct the structure and dynamics of wintertime sea-ice leads and to assess seasonal divergence patterns of the Arctic Ocean.},

The method separates identi?ed leads into two uncertainty categories, with the high uncertainty being attributed to artifacts that arise from warm sigs of unrecognized clouds. Based on the obtained lead detections, we compute quasi-daily pan-Arctic lead maps for the months of January to April, 2003?2015. Our results highlight the marginal ice zone in the Fram Strait and Barents Sea as the primary region for lead activity. The spatial distribution of the average pan-Arctic lead frequencies reveals, moreover, distinct patterns of predominant fracture zones in the Beaufort Sea and along the shelf-breaks, mainly in the Siberian sector of the Arctic Ocean as well as the well-known polynya and fast-ice locations. Additionally, a substantial interannual variability of lead occurrences in the Arctic is indicated.},

The CALIPSO satellite was developed as a joint project between NASA and the French space agency CNES to provide needed capabilities to observe aerosols and clouds from space. CALIPSO carries CALIOP, a two-wavelength, polarization-sensitive lidar, along with two passive sensors operating in the visible and thermal infrared spectral regions. CALIOP is the first lidar to provide long-term atmospheric measurements from Earth's orbit. Its profiling and polarization capabilities offer unique measurement capabilities. Launched together with the CloudSat satellite in April 2006 and now flying in formation with the A-train satellite constellation, CALIPSO is now providing information on the distribution and properties of aerosols and clouds, which is fundamental to advancing our understanding and prediction of climate.

Measurements of these features are of great interest for the improvement of weather and climate models, especially for the Arctic region. In this study, balloon-borne in situ measurements of Arctic cirrus clouds have been analysed for the first time with respect to their origin. Eight cirrus cloud measurements have been carried out in Kiruna (68{$\circ$} N), Sweden, using the Balloon-borne Ice Cloud particle Imager (B-ICI). Ice particle diameters between 10 and 1200 \textmu m have been found and the shape could be recognized from 20 \textmu m upwards. Great variability in particle size and shape is observed. This cannot simply be explained by local environmental conditions. However, if sorted by cirrus origin, wind and weather conditions, the observed differences can be assessed. Number concentrations between 3 and 400 L-1 have been measured, but the number concentration has reached values above 100 L-1 only for two cases. These two cirrus clouds are of in situ origin and have been associated with waves. For all other measurements, the maximum ice particle concentration is below 50 L-1 and for one in situ origin cirrus case only 3 L-1. In the case of in situ origin clouds, the particles are all smaller than 350 \textmu m diameter. The PSDs for liquid origin clouds are much broader with particle sizes between 10 and 1200 \textmu m. Furthermore, it is striking that in the case of in situ origin clouds almost all particles are compact (61 \%) or irregular (25 \%) when examining the particle shape. In liquid origin clouds, on the other hand, most particles are irregular (48 \%), rosettes (25 \%) or columnar (14 \%). There are hardly any plates in cirrus regardless of their origin. It is also noticeable that in the case of liquid origin clouds the rosettes and columnar particles are almost all hollow.},

Satellite retrievals of N suffer from inherent uncertainties, spatial averaging, and retrieval problems arising from the commonly assumed strictly adiabatic vertical profiles of cloud properties. To improve retrievals of N it is suggested in this paper to use a synergetic combination of passive and active airborne remote sensing measurement, to reduce the uncertainty of N retrievals, and to bridge the gap between in situ cloud sampling and global averaging. For this purpose, spectral solar radiation measurements above shallow trade wind cumulus were combined with passive microwave and active radar and lidar observations carried out during the second Next Generation Remote Sensing for Validation Studies (NARVAL-II) campaign with the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO) in August 2016. The common technique to retrieve N is refined by including combined measurements and retrievals of cloud optical thickness {$\tau$}, liquid water path (LWP), cloud droplet effective radius reff, and cloud base and top altitude. Three approaches are tested and applied to synthetic measurements and two cloud scenarios observed during NARVAL-II. Using the new combined retrieval technique, errors in N due to the adiabatic assumption have been reduced significantly.},

  abstract = {A novel approach to compare airborne observations of solar spectral irradiances measured above clouds with along-track radiative transfer simulations (RTS) is presented. The irradiance measurements were obtained with the Spectral Modular Airborne Radiation Measurement System (SMART) installed on the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO). The RTS were conducted using the operational ecRad radiation scheme of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS), operated by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), and a stand-alone radiative transfer solver, the library for Radiative transfer (libRadtran). Profiles of observed and simulated radar reflectivity were provided by the HALO Microwave Package (HAMP) and the Passive and Active Microwave Transfer Model (PAMTRA), respectively. The comparison aims to investigate the capability of the two models to reproduce the observed radiation field. By analyzing spectral irradiances above clouds, different ice cloud optical parameterizations in the models were evaluated. Simulated and observed radar reflectivity fields allowed the vertical representation of the clouds modeled by the IFS to be evaluated, and enabled errors in the IFS analysis data (IFS AD) and the observations to be separated. The investigation of a North Atlantic low pressure system showed that the RTS, in combination with the IFS AD, generally reproduced the observed radiation field. For heterogeneously distributed liquid water clouds, an underestimation of upward irradiance by up to 27\% was found. Simulations of ice-topped clouds, using a specific ice optics parameterization, indicated a systematic underestimation of broadband cloud-top albedo, suggesting major deficiencies in the ice optics parameterization between 1242 and 1941 nm wavelength.},

It is found that the uncertainty of retrieval could be smaller than 0.01, provided the measured intensity profile is smooth enough.

The properties are computed based on a combination of the Amsterdam discrete dipole approximation (ADDA), the T-matrix method, and the improved geometric optics method (IGOM). The electromagnetic edge effect is incorporated into the extinction and absorption efficiencies computed from the IGOM. A full set of single-scattering properties is provided by considering three-dimensional random orientations for 11 ice crystal habits: droxtals, prolate spheroids, oblate spheroids, solid and hollow columns, compact aggregates composed of eight solid columns, hexagonal plates, small spatial aggregates composed of 5 plates, large spatial aggregates composed of 10 plates, and solid and hollow bullet rosettes. The maximum dimension of each habit ranges from 2 to 10 000 {$\mu$}m in 189 discrete sizes. For each ice crystal habit, three surface roughness conditions (i.e., smooth, moderately roughened, and severely roughened) are considered to account for the surface texture of large particles in the IGOM applicable domain. The data library contains the extinction efficiency, single-scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, six independent nonzero elements of the phase matrix (P11, P12, P22, P33, P43, and P44), particle projected area, and particle volume to provide the basic single-scattering properties for remote sensing applications and radiative transfer simulations involving ice clouds. Furthermore, a comparison of satellite observations and theoretical simulations for the polarization characteristics of ice clouds demonstrates that ice cloud optical models assuming severely roughened ice crystals significantly outperform their counterparts assuming smooth ice crystals.},

On the subject of lightscattering simulations, several classical computational approaches are reviewed, including the conventional geometric-opticsmethod and its improved forms, the finite-difference time domain technique, the pseudo-spectral time domain technique, thediscrete dipole approximation method, and theTTT-matrix method, with specific applications to the computation of the single-scattering properties of individual ice crystals. The strengths and weaknesses associated with each approach are discussed.With reference to remote sensing, operational retrieval algorithms are reviewed for retrieving cloud optical depth and effectiveparticle size based on solar or thermal infrared (IR) bands. To illustrate the performance of the current solar- and IR-basedretrievals, two case studies are presented based on spaceborne observations. The need for a more realistic ice cloud opticalmodel to obtain spectrally consistent retrievals is demonstrated. Furthermore, to complement ice cloud property studies basedon passive radiometric measurements, the advantage of incorporating lidar and/or polarimetric measurements is discussed.The performance of ice cloud models based on the use of different ice habits to represent ice particles is illustrated bycomparing model results with satellite observations. A summary is provided of a number of parameterization schemes forice cloud radiative properties that were developed for application to broadband radiative transfer submodels within generalcirculation models (GCMs). The availability of the single-scattering properties of complex ice habits has led to more accurateradiation parameterizations. In conclusion, the importance of using nonspherical ice particle models in GCM simulations forclimate studies is proven.},

High accuracy in such perception systems is being enabled by rapidly evolving convolution neural networks (CNNs). To achieve a better understanding of its surrounding environment, a vehicle must be provided with full coverage via multiple cameras. However, when processing multiple video streams, existing CNN frameworks often fail to provide enough inference performance, particularly on embedded hardware constrained by size, weight, and power limits. This paper presents the results of an industrial case study that was conducted to re-think the design of CNN software to better utilize available hardware resources. In this study, techniques such as parallelism, pipelining, and the merging of per-camera images into a single composite image were considered in the context of a Drive PX2 embedded hardware platform. The study identifies a combination of techniques that can be applied to increase throughput (number of simultaneous camera streams) without significantly increasing per-frame latency (camera to CNN output) or reducing per-stream accuracy.}

An accurate estimation of global contrail radiative forcing is imperative, and the modeling approach is an effective and prominent method to investigate the sensitivity of contrail forcing to various potential factors. We use a simple offline model framework that is particularly useful for sensitivity studies. The most-up-to-date Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5) is employed to simulate the atmosphere and cloud conditions during the year 2006. With updated natural cirrus and additional contrail optical property parameterizations, the RRTMG Model (RRTM-GCM application) is used to simulate the global contrail radiative forcing. Global contrail coverage and optical depth derived from the literature for the year 2002 is used. The 2006 global annual averaged contrail net (shortwave + longwave) radiative forcing is estimated to be 11.3 mW m-2. Regional contrail radiative forcing over dense air traffic areas can be more than ten times stronger than the global average. A series of sensitivity tests are implemented and show that contrail particle effective size, contrail layer height, the model cloud overlap assumption, and contrail optical properties are among the most important factors. The difference between the contrail forcing under all and clear skies is also shown.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ice clouds influence the climate system by changing the radiation budget and large-scale circulation. Therefore, climate models need to have an accurate representation of ice clouds and their radiative effects. In this paper, new broadband parameterizations for ice cloud bulk scattering properties are developed for severely roughened ice particles. The parameterizations are based on a general habit mixture that includes nine habits (droxtals, hollow/solid columns, plates, solid/hollow bullet rosettes, aggregate of solid columns, and small/large aggregates of plates). The scattering properties for these individual habits incorporate recent advances in light-scattering computations. The influence of ice particle surface roughness on the ice cloud radiative effect is determined through simulations with the Fu\textendash Liou and the GCM version of the Rapid Radiative Transfer Model (RRTMG) codes and the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmosphere Model (CAM, version 5.1). The differences in shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative effect at both the top of the atmosphere and the surface are determined for smooth and severely roughened ice particles. While the influence of particle roughening on the single-scattering properties is negligible in the LW, the results indicate that ice crystal roughness can change the SW forcing locally by more than 10 W m-2 over a range of effective diameters. The global-averaged SW cloud radiative effect due to ice particle surface roughness is estimated to be roughly 1\textendash 2 W m-2. The CAM results indicate that ice particle roughening can result in a large regional SW radiative effect and a small but nonnegligible increase in the global LW cloud radiative effect.},

A total of five ice cloud optical property parameterization schemes, including three based on the ice habit mixtures suitable for general ice clouds, mid-latitude synoptic ice clouds, and tropical deep convective ice clouds, and the other two based on single ice habits (smooth hexagonal column and severely roughened column aggregate), are developed under a same framework and are implemented in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Atmospheric Model version 5. A series of atmosphere-only climate simulations are carried out for each of the five cases with different ice parameterizations. The differences in the simulated top of the atmosphere shortwave and longwave cloud radiative effects (CREs) are evaluated, and the global averaged net CRE differences among different cases range from - 1.93 to 1.03 Wm-2. The corresponding changes in simulated surface temperature are found to be most prominent on continental regions which amount to several degrees in Kelvin.

A case study from 23 March 2013 provides a unique view of the cloud microphysical changes over this transition under cold-air outbreak conditions. Cloud base lifted and cloud depth increased over the transition from sea ice to ocean. Mean droplet number concentrations, N drop , also increased from 110 \dbend{} 36 cm ?3 over the sea ice to 145 \dbend{} 54 cm ?3 over the marginal ice zone (MIZ). Downstream over the ocean, N drop decreased to 63 \dbend{} 30 cm ?3 . This reduction was attributed to enhanced collision-coalescence of droplets within the deep ocean cloud layer. The liquid water content increased almost four fold over the transition and this, in conjunction with the deeper cloud layer, allowed rimed snow?akes to develop and precipitate out of cloud base downstream over the ocean. The ice properties of the cloud remained approximately constant over the transition. Observed ice crystal number concentrations averaged approximately 0.5?1.5 L ?1 , suggesting only primary ice nucleation was active; however, there was evidence of crystal fragmentation at cloud base over the ocean. Little variation in aerosol particle number concentrations was observed between the different surface conditions; however, some variability with altitude was observed, with notably greater concentrations measured at higher altitudes ({$>$} 800 m) over the sea ice. Near-surface boundary layer temperatures increased by 13 ? C from sea ice to ocean, with corresponding increases in surface heat ?uxes and turbulent kinetic energy. These signi?cant thermodynamic changes were concluded to be the primary driver of the microphysical evolution of the cloud. This study represents the ?rst investigation, using in situ airborne observations, of cloud microphysical changes with changing sea ice cover and addresses the question of how the microphysics of Arctic stratiform clouds may change as the region warms and sea ice extent reduces.},

  abstract = {Abstract Retrieving and quantifying cloud liquid drop contributions to radar returns from mixed-phase clouds remains a challenge because the radar signal is frequently dominated by the returns from the ice particles within the radar sample volume. We present a technique that extracts the weak cloud liquid drop contributions from the total radar returns in profiling cloud radar Doppler velocity spectra. Individual spectra are first decomposed using a continuous wavelet transform, the resulting coefficients of which are used to identify the region in the spectra where cloud liquid drops contribute. By assuming that the liquid contribution to each Doppler spectrum is Gaussian shaped and centered on an appropriate peak in the wavelet coefficients, the cloud liquid drop contribution may be estimated by fitting a Gaussian distribution centered on the velocity of this peak to the original Doppler spectrum. The cloud liquid drop contribution to reflectivity, the volume mean vertical air motion, subvolume vertical velocity variance, and ice particle mean fall speed can be estimated based on the separation of the liquid contribution to the radar Doppler spectrum. The algorithm is evaluated using synthetic spectra produced from output of a state-of-the-art large eddy simulation model study of an Arctic mixed-phase cloud. The retrievals of cloud liquid drop mode reflectivities were generally consistent with the original model values with errors less than a factor of 2. The retrieved volume mean vertical air velocities reproduced the updraft and downdraft structures, but with an overall bias of approximately -0.06 m s-1. Retrievals based on Ka-band Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Program Zenith Radar observations from Barrow, Alaska, during October 2011 are also presented.},

The relative roles of collection of cloud water by raindrops versus collection of cloud water by ice particles (riming) in the same column are assessed with a one-dimensional (1D) Kessler water-continuity model using the observed data characteristics as input. The OPRA data reveal nearly ubiquitous small-scale fallstreaks each {$<$}5 minutes in duration occurring within a wide range of precipitation intensities. Periods of higher rain rates {$>$}10 minutes in duration associated with convective cells evident in coarser-resolution data manifested as increased frequency and intensity of fallstreaks in the OPRA data. A subset of fallstreaks had sufficient magnitude in reflectivity to indicate a clear connection from the snow region, across the melting layer and into the rain region. The small-scale inhomogeneities in microphysical structure associated with fallstreaks are likely to be associated with convective overturning in the unstable IOP 2b case. In the more stable IOP 8 case, shear-driven turbulence near the melting layer, evident in truck-borne and airborne X-band Doppler-radar data shown in companion studies, is a likely contributor to fallstreak formation. The vertical profile of vertical air velocity (w) is critical to understanding the relationship between collection and riming, and their contributions to precipitation efficiency. Characteristics of the w profile within precipitating cloud were estimated in both rain and snow using observed radar parameters from the OPRA data. In rain, reflectivity-weighted fall speed was derived from observed reflectivity and assumptions about the raindrop size distribution. The derived fall velocity was subtracted from the observed Doppler radial velocity to estimate w in rain regions to within {$\sim$}1.5 m s-1. In snow regions, a lower bound on peak updraught velocity was estimated from the observed maximum Doppler velocity. For the data examined from MAP IOP 2b, typical peak updraught velocities at Locarno-Monti were between 2 and 5 m s-1. These estimated peak updraught velocities were used to construct plausible parabolic profiles of w that were in turn used as input to a 1D Kessler water-continuity model. Model output shows local maxima in the riming rate and mixing ratio of ice within 2 km of the freezing level, indicating a favourable environment for graupel formation. The location of this layer in the model is consistent with the observed occurrence of graupel in National Center for Atmospheric Research S-Pol radar data in the IOP 2b storm in a companion study. The modelled rates of collection and riming are comparable, and both make significant contributions to the growth by accretion of precipitation within the storm updraughts. Within the rain layer, liquid-water coalescence (autoconversion and collection) in updraughts with peak velocities of 5 m s-1 can account for up to {$\sim$}40\% of column-integrated cloud water. Our analysis of the observational data and the 1D model results confirms and extends previous work indicating that a combination of liquid-water coalescence and ice-phase processes is needed to obtain high precipitation efficiencies {$>$}40\% in orographic precipitation.

This study uses collocated airborne radar, lidar, and thermodynamic data from twelve high-altitude flight legs during the Southern Ocean Clouds, Radiation, Aerosol Transport Experimental Study (SOCRATES) to characterize Southern Ocean (SO) cold sector cloud top phase (i.e., within 96 m of top) as a function of cloud top temperature (CTT). A training dataset was developed to create probabilistic phase classifications based on High Spectral Resolution Lidar data and Cloud Radar data. These classifications were then used to identify dominant cloud top phase. Case studies are presented illustrating examples of supercooled liquid water at cloud top at different CTT ranges over the SO (-3\textordmasculine C {$<$} CTTs {$<$} -28\textordmasculine C). During SOCRATES, 67.4\% of sampled cloud top had CTTs less than 0\textordmasculine C. Of the subfreezing cloud tops sampled, 91.7\% had supercooled liquid water present in the top 96 m and 74.9\% were classified entirely as liquidbearing. Liquid-bearing cloud tops were found at CTTs as cold as -30\textordmasculine C. Horizontal cloud extent was also determined as a function of median cloud top height.},

  abstract = {The first 2 year measurements from Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) lidar and CloudSat radar were analyzed to study the distribution and phase partition of midlevel liquid-layer topped stratiform clouds (MLTSC, top higher than 2.5 km above the Earth's surface and top temperature warmer than -40\textdegree C) globally. The global mean MLTSC occurrence was {$\sim$}7.8\% and the global mean MLTSC percentage fraction related to all midlevel clouds was {$\sim$}33.6\%. Strong seasonal and day-night variations of MLTSC occurrence were observed over different latitude regions. In the polar regions, the maximum occurrence was in summer, while the minimum occurred in winter, with small day-night differences. In the tropics, a high MLTSC occurrence band shifted southward from June\textendash July\textendash August to December\textendash January\textendash February with significantly more MLTSC during the nighttime. The global mean MLTSC top height and temperature were {$\sim$}4.5 km above the surface and -13.6\textdegree C. Overall, 61.8\% of MLTSCs were mixed phase and 12.4\% were supercooled liquid (contains only liquid phase or with ice below the detection limit). The fraction of mixed-phase MLTSC increased as the cloud top temperature decreased, with a sharp increase between -10 and -15\textdegree C and a noticeable latitude difference. This temperature dependence indicated that ice nucleation is active at -10\textdegree C in these clouds. The global mean ice water path (IWP) of mixed-phase MLTSCs, estimated based on an empirical temperature\textendash radar reflectivity\textendash ice water content relationship, was {$\sim$}13.4 g/m2, and the IWP increased as cloud top temperature decreased. To improve MLTSC parameterizations in global climate models, further studies are needed to better understand the latitude dependence of MLTSC distributions and microphysical properties and how aerosol and water phase cloud properties affecting ice generation in MLTSCs.},

  abstract = {Clouds play an important role in Earth?s radiation budget and hydrological cycle. However, current global climate models (GCMs) have difficulties in accurately simulating clouds and precipitation. To improve the representation of clouds in climate models, it is crucial to identify where simulated clouds differ from real-world observations of them. This can be difficult, since significant differences exist between how a climate model represents clouds and what instruments observe, both in terms of spatial scale and the properties of the hydrometeors that are either modeled or observed. To address these issues and minimize impacts of instrument limitations, the concept of instrument ?simulators,? which convert model variables into pseudoinstrument observations, has evolved with the goal to facilitate and improve the comparison of modeled clouds with observations. Many simulators have been (and continue to be) developed for a variety of instruments and purposes. A community satellite simulator package, the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP) Observation Simulator Package (COSP; Bodas-Salcedo et al. 2011), contains several independent satellite simulators and is being widely used in the GCM community to exploit satellite observations for model cloud evaluation (e.g., Kay et al. 2012; Klein et al. 2013; Suzuki et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2010). This article introduces a ground-based cloud radar simulator developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) program for comparing climate model clouds with ARM observations from its vertically pointing 35-GHz radars. As compared to the radar measurements made by CloudSat [a satellite carrying the first spaceborne 94-GHz (3.2-mm wavelength) cloud radar], which provides near-global sampling of profiles of cloud condensate and precipitation with a vertical resolution of 500 m (Stephens et al. 2002), ARM radar measurements occur with higher temporal resolution (10 s) and finer vertical resolution (45 m). This enables users to investigate more fully the detailed vertical structures within clouds, resolve thin clouds, and quantify the diurnal variability of clouds. Particularly, ARM radars are sensitive to low-level clouds, which are difficult for the CloudSat radar to detect due to both surface contamination (Mace et al. 2007; Marchand et al. 2008) and a radar sensitivity of approximately ?28 dBZ near the surface. Therefore, the ARM ground-based cloud observations complement measurements from space.},

However, large differences are found in current cloud products retrieved from ground-based remote sensing measurements using various retrieval algorithms. Understanding the differences is an important step to address uncertainties in the cloud retrievals. In this study, an in-depth analysis of nine existing ground-based cloud retrievals using ARM remote sensing measurements is carried out. We place emphasis on boundary layer overcast clouds and high level ice clouds, which are the focus of many current retrieval development efforts due to their radiative importance and relatively simple structure. Large systematic discrepancies in cloud microphysical properties are found in these two types of clouds among the nine cloud retrieval products, particularly for the cloud liquid and ice particle effective radius. Note that the differences among some retrieval products are even larger than the prescribed uncertainties reported by the retrieval algorithm developers. It is shown that most of these large differences have their roots in the retrieval theoretical bases, assumptions, as well as input and constraint parameters. This study suggests the need to further validate current retrieval theories and assumptions and even the development of new retrieval algorithms with more observations under different cloud regimes.},

  abstract = {The interactions between aerosols and ice clouds represent one of the largest uncertainties in global radiative forcing from pre-industrial time to the present. In particular, the impact of aerosols on ice crystal effective radius (Rei), which is a key parameter determining ice clouds' net radiative effect, is highly uncertain due to limited and conflicting observational evidence. Here we investigate the effects of aerosols on Rei under different meteorological conditions using 9-year satellite observations. We find that the responses of Rei to aerosol loadings are modulated by water vapor amount in conjunction with several other meteorological parameters. While there is a significant negative correlation between Rei and aerosol loading in moist conditions, consistent with the ``Twomey effect'' for liquid clouds, a strong positive correlation between the two occurs in dry conditions. Simulations based on a cloud parcel model suggest that water vapor modulates the relative importance of different ice nucleation modes, leading to the opposite aerosol impacts between moist and dry conditions. When ice clouds are decomposed into those generated from deep convection and formed in situ, the water vapor modulation remains in effect for both ice cloud types, although the sensitivities of Rei to aerosols differ noticeably between them due to distinct formation mechanisms. The water vapor modulation can largely explain the difference in the responses of Rei to aerosol loadings in various seasons. A proper representation of the water vapor modulation is essential for an accurate estimate of aerosol\textendash cloud radiative forcing produced by ice clouds.},

The region is subjected to two primary factors: mid \textendash upper level subsidence and lower level cool advection, associated with the Etesian winds. The interdiurnal variations of these factors were found to be correlated with each other, with a maximum of r = 0.76, found between the 700 hPa subsidence and the 925 hPa wind speed. The impact of these factors on the temperature regime was examined through their contributions in the temperature tendency equation at 32.5\textdegree{} N, 35\textdegree{} E. A significant correlation was found between them at the 850 hPa level, indicating that they tend to balance each other. This explains the low interdiurnal temperature variations there in summer. Zonal-vertical and isentropic cross-sections indicate the existence of a closed circulation connecting the EM with the Asian monsoon, and a meridional-vertical cross-section indicates a signature of the Hadley cell across eastern North Africa. Air back-trajectories demonstrate that the EM is connected at the lower troposphere with Europe, at the mid-troposphere with eastern North Africa and at the higher troposphere with the Asian monsoon. Significant correlation was found between the interdiurnal variations in the upward motion over the Asian monsoon and the subsidence over the Levant, with a 1 day lag, implying that the Asian monsoon controls the interdiurnal variations over the Levant. A detailed analysis shows that the correlation between the two dynamic factors governing the EM results from a linkage existing between each one of them and the Asian monsoon. An intensification of the Asian monsoon enhances both the subsidence over the Levant, via the circulation connecting them, and the Etesian winds, due to the enhanced pressure gradient between the two regions.},
